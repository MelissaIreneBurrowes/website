<em>"In our world exist creatures we call Pokémon, and this – which we use to transport them – a miracle of modern technology. A capsule that can lock onto the DNA of living beings, and shrink mass down to size."</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>As Giovanni spoke, he held the red-and-white sphere. It was small enough, in fact, to be held with three fingers, and at a press of a button unlocked into a larger size before opening in a brilliant flash of white light. From the glow emerged a large, cream-furred cat, which meowed and entwined itself around his legs.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>"And to think these beings come in all shapes and powers, with the ability to control elements beyond the wildest understanding of ancient man, and today we harness them in this simple little Poké Ball. Now some people see Pokémon as companions, some use them in battle or for study. Myself...and my organization...we see them as a source of profit.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>"But where profit exists so too does loss...a system of payments and debts."</em>
</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>The don of the Team Rocket syndicate hesitated here and fixed his gaze expectantly on Horatio Dwight, who was deep in debt indeed.</p>

<p>Standing as Giovanni's silent guards in civilian business attire, James and Jessie watched every move, and the two cat Pokémon at their heels watched everything as well. The large feline with the gem on its forehead was Giovanni's pet, called Persian; the smaller one, its singular golden horn gleaming like a coin in the morning light gracing the office, was their own companion Meowth.</p>

<p>They could tell Horatio was disdainful of the cats' presence there in his elegant executive suite. At least he had sense enough not to voice his objections. They would soon see if he was as reasonable in other regards. Giovanni was being entirely straightforward with him:</p>

<p>"We accept payment in three forms: cash, assets, or in the event of unexpected financial issues... blood."</p>

<p>To hear their boss state his policy so neatly, so perfectly, both James and Jessie couldn't help but smirk slightly. They knew it well by now.</p>

<p>Before them, Horatio was apparently just beginning to comprehend. As they watched, his eyes grew wide with disbelief, and a slight shiver of fear coursed through him; a fear that could have saved him.</p>

<p>And then his fear went unheeded, as if he still refused to accept that business with Giovanni Delavita was a matter of life and death and honor.</p>

<p>"Giovanni..." Horatio said, addressing him with tragic self-assurance, "aren't you getting kind of overwrought over a measly 5 grand?"</p>

<p>"<em>50</em>," Giovanni specified, his voice edged with ice.</p>

<p>"Okay, so the loan was 50 grand. I'll pay you back," he insisted irreverently, right as the phone on his desk rang and he snatched up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Dwight." He was briefly quiet, then added a little crossly, "Tell them to call back. I'm in a meeting now with Mr. Delavita. ...yes."</p>

<p>He hung up and turned back to Giovanni.</p>

<p>"Give me another couple of months," maintained Horatio, without much interest.</p>

<p>"The value of your business could easily cover the cost right now," Giovanni pointed out. "As I said, Poké Balls are an invaluable modern commodity. I believe in one year your sales of specialty Poké Balls earn half the amount..."</p>

<p>Horatio stopped him. "You talk like you're doing me a favor."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"I'm not selling," Horatio snapped. "And besides, your Rocket Enterprises has already bought out almost every Poké Ball manufacturer around the globe. What are you even trying to do? Look, just...give me another couple of months, okay? I'll get you your money."</p>

<p>Giovanni stroked Persian once, but kept his sight locked on Horatio. "Your first mistake was stealing from your company accounts thinking you could replace the funds easily. Your second mistake was trying to win it back at the battles. You're running a pyramid game but your biggest mistake of all, Mr. Dwight, was thinking you could play that game with Team Rocket. You never bet against the house unless you know you can pay."</p>

<p>Somehow this awareness of his maneuvers and expenditures alike unnerved him more than anything yet said. However it was when Giovanni took the rose from the jacket pocket of his suit, and threw it to James who deftly caught it, when Horatio truly went pale.</p>

<p>It was a signal.</p>

<p>Not another word was said as Giovanni snapped his fingers at James and Jessie to follow him, turned and left. The cats brought up the rear. Horatio watched them depart, still secretly wondering if there was a way he could wriggle out of paying the debt.</p>

<p>Giovanni and his entourage stepped out to the waiting limousine, and the chauffeur immediately opened the door. The Persian picked up its pace to scamper ahead and hop inside.</p>

<p>"We'll give him the rest of the work day," Giovanni was telling his associates succinctly. "He typically leaves his office at around five-thirty."</p>

<p>Giovanni always had a certain dangerous quietude to him. He was somewhere in his late forties, with dark hair slicked back and unfailing attired in the finest tailored suits; a businessman before all, nevermind the questionable majority of his dealings. Publicly everyone knew him as the owner of the now multi-billion private company Rocket Enterprises and the gym leader of Viridian City. Privately everyone knew he was the head of Team Rocket, and Rocket Enterprises was but a front for the world's most powerful crime syndicate.</p>

<p>When his transceiver phone suddenly rang from his suit pocket, Giovanni retrieved the device and answered immediately. "What?"</p>

<p>An indistinguishable voice could be heard on the other end as he listened intently.</p>

<p>"Thank you for calling. Your loyalty is noted," he replied.</p>

<p>Hanging up, Giovanni addressed James, Jessie, and Meowth still standing before him.</p>

<p>"Put your orders on hold until we return from a brief trip to Pallet Town," said Giovanni.</p>

<p>Jessie and James looked at each other but said nothing as they got into the vehicle with him. They knew better than to ask too many questions when the objective involved Pallet Town.</p><hr />

<p>Ash Ketchum sprinted downstairs, his pet Pikachu clinging happily to his cap.</p>

<p>"Ash, you're up so early!" remarked his mother, who was sitting at the table going through some papers.</p>

<p>"I want to get a head start," replied Ash. "I've packed already and I'm ready to go." His ebony hair and eyes were much darker than the auburn and light-brown of his mother, but what he lacked of her complexion he inherited in mild temperament. That said he was immensely passionate about Pokémon and had been all his life. He wore a red-and-white trainer's cap, with a vest to match, and had a brown backpack slung over one shoulder; he was the very picture of what he was, an ambitious Pokémon trainer setting off on his journey.</p>

<p>"All boys leave home someday," she acknowledged, "but it's only the day after your eighteenth birthday."</p>

<p>"The sooner I start on my journey, the sooner I can collect all eight badges to challenge the Elite Four and become a true Pokémon master," Ash said cheerfully, and turned to his Pokémon companion. "Isn't that right, Pikachu?"</p>

<p>"<em>Pi...caaa</em>," Pikachu gave a happy noise of trilling squeaks, the sounds for which its species had been named. It was squirrel-like, with short yellow fur, long ears tipped with black, and a jagged plumed tail; when Ash reached up to pet it, the tame little creature let out cheery electric sparks from its cheeks and descended to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You have your father's spirit of ambition," said Ash's mother.</p>

<p>She spoke with recognition, and maybe a tinge of melancholy. When he looked up from Pikachu she gave a small shake of her head, as if dispelling a memory of long ago.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Professor Oak was looking for you."</p>

<p>"Okay mom...will you be home all day?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm taking a trip to the tax office downtown. There's something I need to talk to them about."</p>

<p>Ash walked over to his mother and putting his hand on her shoulder asked, "Is everything all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ash. Don't worry...just go and live your life, always remembering that I'm proud of you." She got up from her seat and hugged him.</p>

<p>"Thanks mom," Ash said as he went out the door.</p><hr />

<p>Professor Samuel Oak was a foremost authority on Pokémon, having spent countless years in field research as a wildlife biologist, and in his youth had been an accomplished trainer in his own right. He was the inventor of the Pokédex – the world's most complete list of known Pokémon, and had made it into a small handheld device that could easily bring up species information by scanning any animal. All this had made him something of a local celebrity; he lectured regularly at Celadon University, and a radio station in the Johto region invited him to establish a broadcast program discussing Pokémon habitats. Fame was not something Oak coveted, however; the peace of his laboratory here in Pallet Town and further academic pursuit therein was far more to his liking.</p>

<p>Ash arrived at Professor Oak's laboratory to find the place in disarray. Papers were strewn about, as well as three small bowls with kibble scattered everywhere. Oak was trying to recapture three little Pokémon, which scampered playfully around the room, dodging both the recall beam of the Poké Balls and Oak's futile attempts to grab them. Ash recognized the creatures as the grass frog Bulbasaur, the fire salamander Charmander, and the water turtle Squirtle.</p>

<p>"Do you need some help catching these Pokémon?" asked Ash dubiously.</p>

<p>"Yes – <em>ow</em>!" replied Oak, bumping his head below a table as he tried unsuccessfully to seize the Bulbasaur underneath, and the Pokémon ran off, "I let them out to feed them but they decided to fight each other instead, and now they're running around half-wild."</p>

<p>"Pikachu, you take the left; I'll take the right," said Ash, and his Pokémon hopped down immediately.</p>

<p>Together, Ash and Pikachu managed to corral the three escapees. They lined up almost instinctively, responding to him as if he were their trainer.</p>

<p>"The three of you are a rascally bunch, aren't you?" Ash was smiling as he petted them on the head.</p>

<p>Oak never ceased to marvel at Ash's ease with animals, and he remarked upon it. "You've always had a way with Pokémon. They naturally listen to you."</p>

<p>"They're kind creatures. It's all a matter of making friends with them."</p>

<p>"Alas, if only people could be more like Pokémon and not be cruel-hearted."</p>

<p>"Deep down I really don't think there's anyone truly evil," commented Ash as he recalled the three little animals to their Poké Balls and handed them to Oak. "Anyway, was there something you wanted to see me about, Professor?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to give you this before you set out," Oak replied, retrieving a small red device about the size of a handheld calculator from atop his desk.</p>

<p>"This is the latest version of the Pokédex. It has data on over one-thousand species," explained Oak. "To make a complete guide on all the Pokémon in the world... That was my dream! I came very close, but there are still many Pokémon out there we know nothing about. Maybe you'll encounter some of those along the way."</p>

<p>Ash thanked Professor Oak for the gift, and he in turn hurried him along.</p>

<p>"Now you'd better get going," said Oak, "Gary already left last night with his Pokémon."</p>

<p>"Last night?" Ash exclaimed. "Damn it, I can't believe Blue got ahead of me!"</p>

<p>Gary was Professor Oak's grandson, and the same age as Ash. When it came to Pokémon, Ash and Gary had been rivals since childhood. It was a friendly rivalry like brothers, but Pallet Town was small, and everybody knew everybody, so it followed that everyone knew of their incessant competition as to who could raise Pokémon better. The townspeople would often say they were as distinct as red and blue; it caught on as Ash was nicknamed Red, and Gary was called Blue, and quickly became a running joke between the two that had persisted even into adulthood.</p>

<p>He darted out of the laboratory with Pikachu, crossing paths with his mother, who watched him race in the direction of the outlying meadowland of route 1 and the official start of his quest. Going off to challenge the Pokémon League with one's prized pet was something of a rite of passage; most everyone went travelling with their Pokémon upon coming of age, even if they did not fully expect to make a career of it.</p>

<p>Ash, however, did wish to make a career of it. It had been his aspiration to someday challenge the Elite Four with Pikachu, and then use the lofty credentials of having acquired eight badges to find employment somewhere within the Pokémon League in Kanto; or conversely, continue his travels to other regions and challenge the gyms there. Having raised Ash as a single mother, and his being her only child, somehow seeing him go off brought worry despite knowing his adventuring was a given.</p>

<p>Then again, perhaps it was more a worry of where his journey would inevitably lead. Oak's voice broke into her thoughts.</p>

<p>"...did you ever tell him about his father?"</p>

<p>"His father was a skilled trainer, but he died on his journey. The reason we have no photographs is because it still hurts too much."</p>

<p>"Except it's not the truth," Oak pointed out.</p>

<p>She remained silent.</p>

<p>"Delia, you and I have known each other for a very long time. Ash is old enough to know who his father is... I've been proud to be a father figure for him, but don't you think you should have told him?"</p>

<p>"Samuel..." Her voice trailed into admission, "I'm not...ready to tell him."</p>

<p>"This is not about you," Oak insisted, "it's about him. He has a right to know and it's up to you to tell him."</p>

<p>Delia sighed, but did not respond to this statement. "Thanks Samuel...for always being there for us." She hugged him briefly.</p>

<p>His shoulders drooped in resignation. "He's going to have to challenge the gyms," Oak said simply, and then added more emphatically:</p>

<p>"He's going to have to challenge <em>all</em> the gyms."</p><hr />

<p>Pallet Town's tax office was located in the business area. Since most of the town was rural, houses were spread at a wide distance from each other and all the businesses were centralised in the Main Street area.</p>

<p>All eyes were on a black limousine with blinded windows that drove up to the front of the building. As soon as Giovanni Delavita and his guards, Jessie, James and Meowth stepped out, pedestrians turned their backs and went on with whatever routine they were engaged in. Nobody wanted trouble.</p>

<p>The leader of Team Rocket walked up to the front desk and with one swift motion, hit a bell ringer that was placed on the counter.</p>

<p>A door opened and a man of about age 50 wearing a suit, appeared from another room.</p>

<p>"You are the clerk in charge, I presume?" Giovanni asked.</p>

<p>"Yes sir...Mr. Delavita," the man answered with visible nervousness, "How may I help you, sir?"</p>

<p>"There is an account in arrears which I am here to take care of," he replied.</p>

<p>The clerk hurried to type information into a computer. "Name of the account please?"</p>

<p>"Delia Ketchum."</p>

<p>"Yes... here it is," the man said as he scrutinised the account on the screen, "This property is in foreclosure proceedings, sir."</p>

<p>"How much is due?" asked Giovanni.</p>

<p>"Well, it hasn't been paid for about two years, let me get the file..."</p>

<p>The clerk walked quickly to a file cabinet and pulled out a folder with the name 'Ketchum, Delia' written in the top flap margin. He opened it and took out a document bearing a monetary figure over ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Giovanni pulled out a checkbook from the inner pocket of his suit, wrote a check out for the full amount and handing it to the clerk said, "Paid in full. Give me the receipt, stamp the bill 'Paid' and make sure nobody tells Ms. Ketchum who paid it off, understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir...but...this is a substantial amount...what if she demands to know?"</p>

<p>Giovanni grasped the man by the lapels of his suit with both hands and looked him straight in the eyes. "Do you agree that life is valuable?"</p>

<p>The trio of Giovanni's guards watched carefully to see if their boss gave any signal, and the tension in the room grew enormously.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course...sir," stammered the clerk.</p>

<p>"Then you know nothing, and you say nothing... <em>capisce</em>?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. I'm glad you are a reasonable man," Giovanni answered, releasing him.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said as the clerk processed the payment exactly as the Team Rocket leader requested, handed him the receipt and wished him "a nice day."</p>

<p>Giovanni walked past his guards and nodding his head at them ordered simply, "Let's go."</p>

<p>That same afternoon about an hour later, Delia Ketchum walked into the tax office. She had a sad face as she walked up to the counter where the clerk was busy organising some papers.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," she began, "May I speak with the head accountant please?"</p>

<p>The clerk looked up from his work and asked, "Your name please."</p>

<p>"Delia Ketchum."</p>

<p>She noticed the man freeze and stare at her for a moment, before she could ask anything more, he said:</p>

<p>"Ms. Ketchum, perhaps I can be of assistance to you... What is it you need?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted to discuss some sort of payment arrangement. I know my account is past due...I don't have enough money to pay in full. Please... it's the only home I've ever had... I..." her voice broke off at this point and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>The clerk spoke quickly, "Miss there's no need to worry, the bill has been paid in full."</p>

<p>Delia's eyes opened wide and she asked, "How?"</p>

<p>The clerk simply typed into the computer and replied, "I am verifying it right now. The account was paid in full by an anonymous benefactor."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"There must be some record...I want to thank them... Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Unknown," insisted the clerk, "that is why we label it as an anonymous benefactor."</p>

<p>Delia was in momentary shock. She stood there speechless, and the clerk leant over the counter and whispered to her, "Lady, take it and run...don't ask any more questions."</p>

<p>"Thank you," was Delia's response, as she turned around and left.</p>

<p>When she arrived home, she was greeted with another surprise. On her doorstep were two dozen red roses with a card that read simply:</p>

<p>"<em>il mio amore è eterno</em>"</p>

<p>Delia inhaled the sweet fragrance of the flowers and a small smile crossed her face.</p>

<p>As she walked into her house, she did not notice the trio observing from a distance away atop one of the meadow hills. Jessie lowered her binoculars and turned towards her companions James and Meowth. "Our job here is done. Let's get back and tell Giovanni she seemed happy with the flowers."</p>

<p>They all got up to leave, but James lingered watching the peaceful town below. "Jessie," he mused, "have you ever thought what it would be like for us, if we were as those people down there... Just regular civilians... living our lives, together, on our own terms?"</p>

<p>"Maybe one day it will happen," replied Jessie.</p>

<p>It was a sunny afternoon bearing one of the last warm breezes of summer. In the bright sunlight, Jessie's scarlet hair took on an almost magenta hue, and her blue eyes reflected the daylight with their inexhaustible sparkle of life. James found himself admiring his companion's features, angular yet soft and with a warmth she only divulged to him, and most of all that <em>joie de vivre</em> they shared with each other.</p>

<p>Meowth had stood up on his hind paws, and now jumped into the humans' conversation, "That's the dream, but who are we kidding?"</p>

<p>Most animals did not talk the human language, though they all understood it, and few had learnt to be bipedal. Meowth was unique, though he typically took care to hide his talents in public.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled wistfully to herself, "You know Meowth is right, James. No one leaves our kind of life."</p>

<p>James sighed, but agreed. "It leaves <em>us</em> in the end, probably with some kind of cruel irony."</p>

<p>To which Jessie took his hand in hers, and Meowth added his paw atop theirs in a gesture of familial unity.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go as a team...and in the meantime," Jessie added with her usual vivacity, "why worry about any of it? We live the moment, as we always do. We find our happiness where and while we can, together."</p>

<p>"That's right!" Meowth chimed in cheerfully. "Speaking of which, I gotta get going guys...I've got some cat things to do. I'll see you later at the apartment."</p>

<p>He scampered off on all fours as Jessie and James waved at him.</p>

<p>"You know we've got like three hours before we have to get back to work," remarked James. "Three hours of an impossible dream."</p>

<p>They kissed, and in silent embrace walked away from Pallet Town.</p><hr />

<p>To be a Team Rocket agent in the popular conception meant glamorous power and corrupt wealth, weaving its mystique like smoke into imagery of sinister backroom meetings and deadly dealings. Their very name, contrary to the motif the syndicate had since adopted, was a corruption on the term <em>racket</em>, as in racketeering. It was yet another mischievous manner in which Giovanni conducted his business in plain sight.</p>

<p>As far as Jessica Scordato and James Marchesi were concerned, the authorities knew they were involved with Team Rocket but could never get concrete evidence against them, and if any was ever found it always conveniently disappeared. Witnesses, too.</p>

<p>There was about an hour or so left till five-thirty when James dialled Giovanni's direct line on their telephone at their apartment, and waited. The phone rang only twice.</p>

<p>"Everything still on for tonight?" asked James.</p>

<p>"Not a word back from Mr. Dwight," Giovanni replied. "Your assignment stands as usual."</p>

<p>"Got it," said James briskly, and the phone hung up.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and the duo tensed for a moment. "Who is it?" asked James.</p>

<p>"It's <em>Meee</em>-owth," was the reply.</p>

<p>Jessie opened the door and let the cat in.</p>

<p>"Have you guys ordered food yet? I'm starved," he meowed, hopping atop one of the nightstands.</p>

<p>"We just got off the phone with the boss," answered Jessie as she closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Assignment still stands for tonight," James informed him.</p>

<p>"You can fill me in as we eat," Meowth said, picking up the phone receiver with a paw; he dialled and after a couple of rings, spoke. "Hello, I'd like to order a pizza..."</p>

<p>"No tiny fish sprinkled over it Meowth!" interjected James.</p>

<p>"<em>Pfffft</em>" the cat hissed at him.</p>

<p>"Cheese," added Jessie.</p>

<p>The cat turned his attention back to the phone. "Cheese pizza please, large size...how much is it? Okay thanks."</p>

<p>"Well? When's eating time, Meowth?" asked James.</p>

<p>"An hour," replied the cat.</p>

<p>Jessie sat next to James on the bed, turned to him and said, "Can you imagine if the pizza place clerk knew that it was a cat ordering?"</p>

<p>James grinned saying, "That would be a fun reaction to watch, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Punctually one hour after Meowth got off the phone, the delivery man arrived with the order.</p>

<p>James took the pizza from him, and Jessie handed over a bill. "Keep the change."</p>

<p>The delivery man was new and the minute he saw the amount his eyes flew open wide with surprise. He started to question but decided against it just as hurriedly. "Thank you," he said sincerely, as they shut the door.</p>

<p>As Jessie and James returned to the dining table with the food, Meowth beat them there and hopped up onto one of the chairs.</p>

<p>"They probably know us already as the apartment that gives giant tips," meowed the cat.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't we? We can afford it," answered Jessie, swatting at Meowth playfully. </p>

<p>After they finished eating it was time to get to work again. They showered and dressed in their Team Rocket uniforms, which they wore when the circumstances warranted; this being one of those times.</p>

<p>Team Rocket's typical black uniforms bore a bright red R on the shirt. Being elite agents of the crime syndicate, James and Jessie's attire was even more flashy: trim white outfits with black, patent-leather boots and gloves, and the signature red R. On their belts they carried Poké Balls as well as coiled whips. The Team Rocket syndicate adored the occasional spectacle; it was a way to keep their name publicised but their true operations in the shadows, as Giovanni would say. Otherwise they had to dress in civilian clothes as a way to go undetected in public.</p>

<p>By this hour twilight was descending over the city, casting a glow towards the stadium in the east. It was illuminated for a battle competition to be held tonight and stood out as the Team Rocket trio made their way to the rooftop of a nearby building.</p>

<p>One of the most lucrative of black-market trades were Pokémon – the combative, element-wielding animals were easily a mainstay of the world's economy. Catching wild Pokémon was as easy as hunting in the wooded routes outlying the cities, but acquiring <em>strong</em> ones oftentimes required a bit more finesse.</p>

<p>"James," said Jessie, turning to her companion playfully, "what do you think the boss would say if we brought back some of those powerful Pokémon being entered in the colosseum tournament?"</p>

<p>"Commend us for our talent in theft," replied James with the same mischief.</p>

<p>Meowth, to the contrary, gave a hiss.</p>

<p>"Enough with the flights of fancy," growled the cat. "We got one job right now and it doesn't mean making a big scene."</p>

<p>"Meowth, you're a sourpuss today," James teased.</p>

<p>To which Meowth gave an agreeable purr. "That's why I get sent along as top cat. I keep you two in line."</p>

<p>"Shush, the guy's coming," Jessie announced, and they all scrambled to pull the binoculars back up to their eyes.</p>

<p>They could see Horatio coming out of the building across the street, looking tentative as he approached his car along the sidewalk, ducking to examine underneath, opening the hood, making a veritable show till at last he crept into the driver's seat and, gingerly, turned the key in the ignition.</p>

<p>When it started uneventfully, he gave a visible sigh of relief.</p>

<p>From their position up high, the Team Rocket trio watched him drive off in the car. When he had gone only a block, they lowered the binoculars.</p>

<p>They lifted a bazooka, took aim, and watched the car go up in flames.</p>

<p>Amidst the fiery chaos and clamour of gawking bystanders, no one paid heed to the couple and the cat strolling by, nor how the man tossed a rose towards the wreckage in symbolism, before the trio dissipated into the crowd.</p>

<p>The debt had been collected in full.</p>

<p>VIRIDIAN CITY, THREE DAYS LATER</p>

<p>Cold rain pattered down incessantly, an unrelenting siege of a downpour. James and Jessie huddled together, the former holding a large black umbrella for shelter, as they pushed into the Viridian gym.</p>

<p>The gym lobby was well-lit and elegant, with flooring of antique white marble and walls in pale tan that complemented a reception desk across from the entrance. The rain could still be heard faintly as it continued assailing the outside of the building. James closed the dripping umbrella as he and Jessie parted; on his shoulder, he felt Meowth's claws release their clinging grip as the cat hopped down.</p>

<p>The trio went up a spiral staircase to the second floor where their boss' office was located. When they got there the lights were turned off and the office door was locked.</p>

<p>"Bummer," mumbled Jessie, "Guess we have to wait; who knows how long for the boss to get here."</p>

<p>"I should've guessed," James grumbled, "I'm not having a good day."</p>

<p>She looked over at James who was resting his back against the wall and noticed there was a larger than usual bulge in his crotch area. "James, don't tell me you're horny?"</p>

<p>"Jessie, you know when we miss our mornings together, my body protests...I'm getting a hard one and..." He looked at her with pleading eyes, "...well, you know."</p>

<p>Jessie got a smile on her face and walking over to him, pressed her body to his and put her hands on his head, stroking his violet hair and caressing his ears ever so slightly. She kissed him, and he put his arms around her waist and returned the kiss with the same passion.</p>

<p>They entirely disregarded Meowth, who had been silently watching – even to the point they lowered themselves to the floor; James lifted her skirt and pulled down her underwear; Jessie unzipped his pants and he lifted out completely erect.</p>

<p>Meowth finally spoke up. "You guys...the boss won't like that you're doing this in front of his office."</p>

<p>"Meowth, go away for a while. Keep watch for the boss and let us know when he gets here," James said.</p>

<p>"Yeah Meowth...leave!" added Jessie.</p>

<p>The cat swished his tail but strolled away without saying anything else, and Jessie and James went on with their moment of pleasure until they were interrupted by a noise of footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>They both looked up and froze upon seeing their boss, Giovanni Delavita.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by Persian, and catching up in the rear was Meowth.</p>

<p>Giovanni had a bored look on his face. "James, put your dick back in your pants; this isn't the time or place for that. This is why I provide you agents with rent-free apartments," he said, then added with emphasis, "elegant ones!"</p>

<p>They both rushed to get dressed as James gave the cat a frowning look. "Meowth! You were supposed to be keeping watch!"</p>

<p>Meowth gave a sharp little hiss. "Don't lay the blame on me just 'cause you two got caught with your pants down."</p>

<p>Giovanni walked on ahead indifferently while the trio rushed after him. He flipped the light switch on and sat down at his office desk, his ever-loyal Persian settling beside him. Meowth lingered just inside the doorway while Jessie and James stood at attention before the desk, their faces rather flushed.</p>

<p>"At ease," Giovanni ordered, as the duo relaxed their stance, "What have you found out regarding Silph?"</p>

<p>James began speaking. "Well...the Silph Company is a very lucrative business... at a point of being the last serious competitor for Rocket Enterprises. It's the only large-scale Poké Ball manufacturer left besides our own acquisitions."</p>

<p>Jessie jumped into the conversation. "Mr. Edward Silph holds controlling interest, and he's become quite popular within the Kanto region's social circles. He's popular outside it too; word is he's been connecting with business leaders in the Orre region."</p>

<p>"In <i>Orre</i>?" Giovanni remarked. "Supposedly that desert wasteland has been experiencing some sort of a renaissance lately, but is it really enough to attract the attention of someone like Silph?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, but no one seems to know who he's been in talks with over there."</p>

<p>Giovanni thought about this for a moment, then said, "He might be a bother now but he might eventually become a genuine problem. Acquiring Silph's holdings should be a simple matter though. Soon, it will all be mine."</p>

<p>"Sir, with all respect," James ventured, "we're the strongest and most feared syndicate in the world already. Do we really need any more?"</p>

<p>Giovanni side-eyed him. "What is the ultimate goal of Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>"Profit."</p>

<p>"There's your answer," said Giovanni. "One can never have too much money and power. If we're the strongest, it's only because we haven't let anyone else become stronger... I will speak with him."</p>

<p>This silenced any further inquiry on the matter, and Giovanni picked up the phone receiver and dialed. It was answered on the other end after only two rings.</p>

<p>"Silph Company; Mr. Silph's office. May I help you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Giovanni began, "This is Mr. Delavita at Rocket Enterprises. Would you kindly tell Mr. Silph that I wish to speak with him."</p>

<p>"One moment sir."</p>

<p>After a brief time, Silph's voice came over the phone, "Delavita... how good of you to call. Is there something I can do?"</p>

<p>"Silph, I'll get straight to the point. I'd like to buy out your company's holdings in the Poké Ball industry."</p>

<p>"I hadn't really thought of selling... What percentage did you have in mind to buy?" asked Mr. Silph tentatively.</p>

<p>"All of it," affirmed Giovanni, "Your production plants, the apricorn orchards, and the tumblestone mines."</p>

<p>He was met with laughter. Giovanni petted Persian indifferently as the large cat clambered onto his lap, and remarked, "I fail to see the humor, Mr. Silph. In fact I'm prepared to offer you a substantial amount for the company shares."</p>

<p>Silph recovered himself, but incredulity crept into his voice. "You have Macro Cosmos. Not to mention you bought out Devon. Rocket Enterprises is currently our largest competitor."</p>

<p>"We're currently your only competitor," emphasized Giovanni, a little smugly.</p>

<p>"I really don't see why you'd need Silph. Unless you're simply trying to acquire a monopoly in the Poké Ball manufacturing industry, in which case I admire your ambition."</p>

<p>Giovanni smiled to himself, still petting Persian. The cat squinted its eyes with contentment as a purr rumbled in its throat. "Ambition is less important, I believe, than foresight. For everyone involved." He lingered meaningfully on the statement. "How much for the Silph Company?"</p>

<p>"Not interested," was the quick response.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Giovanni persisted, "I would like to discuss the matter further with you at a later time."</p>

<p>"That's fine, we can talk later on."</p>

<p>"<i>Ciao</i>," was Giovanni's simple farewell, and he heard the click of the phone as Silph hung up. He turned to Jessie and James still standing before him and said, "I will summon you when I have formulated my plans on this situation."</p>

<p>This was a well known cue for the duo to leave. They dipped their heads in respect and walked out of the office with the cat Meowth tagging behind them.</p>

<p>The Team Rocket leader sat in his office alone, except for his beloved Persian keeping him company. He stroked the cat's head as it continued to purr. "Soon, my friend. Soon," he remarked.</p>

<p>When the cat gave a small trill, Giovanni nodded as if with comprehension. "But of course our resources are being stretched thin," he spoke to Persian, with the sort of informality one might have talking to an old friend. "With Butch and Cassidy having to manage the Macro Cosmos acquisitions away in the Galar region, to say nothing of our properties in Hoenn, that leaves only James and Jessie as admins here in Kanto to handle local affairs. James is right saying we are currently the strongest syndicate in the world...but our organization barely has the manpower to properly oversee so many multi-regional assets. We're actually in dire need of new recruits." A thought occurred to Giovanni.</p>

<p>"I wonder how Archer is doing with the cadets in Johto."</p><hr />

<p>"I want to join Team Rocket."</p>

<p>Archer eyed the girl askance; really he could not imagine how brazen you'd have to be to walk up to a stranger with such a request, nor the reasoning behind it. At least out here, outside of the Pokémon Center alongside route 32 and Union Cave, they were at a good distance from any other travelling trainers who could hear, but she was still very bold. "I'm sorry, what did you say your name was...?"</p>

<p>"Krystal," she answered promptly, with a smile. "Though everyone calls me Kris."</p>

<p>"You look kind of young."</p>

<p>"I'm 18."</p>

<p>She could be 18, he evaluated dubiously, though she could easily have been 16. Her teal hair was a shade darker than his own, and she had swept it up into two ponytails that fell to her shoulders. In her arms she held a fox-cat Pokémon called an Eevee, which watched him with the same wide-eyed enthusiasm she seemed to bear. Archer did not trust her or the Eevee.</p>

<p>"And tell me Kris..." he posed cautiously, "why do you think I'm part of Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>"My Eevee told me," Kris admitted.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can talk to your Eevee?" <em>As if it wasn't enough Giovanni's Persian doubles as our consigliere,</em> he thought with a narrowly hidden scowl, <em>or James and Jessie with their gossipy Meowth. Now this girl talks with her Eevee. What the fuck.</em></p>

<p>"Please let us join!" she insisted, "We're really good fighters. Yesterday we won against the Violet City gym. And Eevee's close to evolving."</p>

<p>Archer was debating the situation. <em>Is she a plant by the authorities, or actually legit?</em></p>

<p>"We've been working for Professor Elm's laboratory in New Bark Town till now. I'm one of his research assistants."</p>

<p><em>If she's a plant I ought to get rid of her,</em> thought Archer. <em>Then again she could just be stupid.</em></p>

<p>"I know a lot about Pokémon training and care, and all the ways to increase their strength. That could be useful in Team Rocket right? We can help out however the organization needs."</p>

<p><em>I'll let her live for now,</em> Archer decided, and returned a convincing smile. "I don't know who gave you...em...your Eevee the idea I'm part of Team Rocket, but I can assure you I'm merely a businessman on a trip to Johto to handle some minor financial affairs for my employer. It's honestly as simple as that."</p>

<p>"Who is your employer?"</p>

<p>"Rocket Enterprises."</p>

<p>Everyone and their uncle knew that company was the front for Team Rocket, though, and seeing the spark in her eyes Archer realized he had only encouraged her. Kris was relentless.</p>

<p>"I'd like to apply for a position at Rocket Enterprises, then."</p>

<p>"I'd have to pass that along to our personnel department."</p>

<p>The response evidently satisfied her, and as Kris bid farewell and left happily for Union Cave with her Eevee, Archer realized with dismay that she was heading in the same direction he needed to go – Azalea Town. <em>Damn it, why do I feel like this is going to come back to haunt me?</em></p><hr />

<p>Archer Verdi was about twenty-eight in age, with teal hair he always kept combed back and naturally refined characteristics only complemented by his grey, tailored vest-suit attire. Being the godson of Giovanni, Archer had been tasked with training a detachment of Team Rocket cadets; a job only the most loyal were trusted with, but one that Archer saw as a chore. He had never wanted to be appointed to train these new recruits. He was impatient by nature, and impatience did not lend itself well to the role of being a teacher. It really didn't lend itself well to group activities either, which made him the only elite member of Team Rocket who routinely worked without a partner.</p>

<p>His intent was to meet up with the group at Azalea, where they were managing a little project. Azalea was one of the most out-of-the-way towns he had visited, Archer reflected as he walked through Union Cave, his pace quick enough to avoid most wild Pokémon but not so hastened as to appear timid. The path to Azalea was long enough as it was to deal with the innumerable nuisances of Zubat and Rattata; his Houndoom could easily roast them, but it was a waste of valuable time.</p>

<p>The town itself was nestled peacefully amidst nature, the mouth of Union Cave to one side and the dense woodland known as Ilex Forest on the other. The cave and the forest provided the only ways in or out, save the sky if one had a bird Pokémon; in a way it was Azalea's relative distance from the rest of civilization that made it exceptionally easy for Team Rocket to conduct business there. No one could get word out unless Team Rocket permitted it. No one could get out, period.</p>

<p>Smiling slightly at the situation they had trapped the townspeople in, Archer pushed through the last stretch of the cave to the small apricorn grove that purported to be route 33, and strolled nonchalantly into Azalea as if all that land was his.</p>

<p>At least the people of Azalea were being smart. The few haughty ones had been soundly defeated in Pokémon battles and summarily cowed into submission, so the town's small population hadn't yet decreased; no one had dared challenge Team Rocket since that incident.</p>

<p>Overlooking the apricorn grove was a grassy slope, and as its centerpiece was a wide stone well with steps leading into its depths. Two Team Rocket guards had been stationed beside it, and next to the stone circle was a sign that read:</p>

<p align="center">
<em>Slowpoke Well</em>
</p>

<p>With a quick nod of his head as acknowledgement to the guards, Archer descended into what was less a well and more an underground chasm. Nature's erosion, aided by an underground spring, had carved out rock formations and begot a spacious habitat for wild Slowpoke.</p>

<p>They were everywhere here, lounging on the boulders, soaking in the water, and so tame they walked up to anybody with innocuous curiosity. Hunting them in this place was forbidden by law, due to the Slowpoke being beloved by locals and respected for myths claiming the animals dispelled drought.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them all, Team Rocket did not play by the rules.</p>

<p>Archer strolled over to a couple of the trainees, who immediately stood at attention to see him. "How have things been going while I was away?" he asked them.</p>

<p>"Quiet as ever," they replied. "We had to send for some more cages, though it's not like we really need them. The Slowpoke are so docile they don't even seem to have a self-preservation instinct."</p>

<p>He gave a sharp laugh. "Can you believe how damn easy this is? And to think these aren't even strong Pokémon; their only value is their meat!"</p>

<p>"I know Giovanni had a dispute with Seafoam Farms outside of Fuschia City," another remarked, "but I really don't see how poaching Slowpoke ourselves is a good investment."</p>

<p>"You see," explained Archer, "if we can harvest Slowpoke for no cost, we sell at lower prices than they do. Consequently we make a fortune, drive them out of business, and Team Rocket snaps up their ranch. It's common sense... Don't act so dumb," he added in a caustic way.</p>

<p>They frowned slightly but did not respond; they all knew better. Archer glanced up to the entrance as a third minion announced, "By the way there's a newcomer in town with an Eevee."</p>

<p>"And where is said newcomer?" Archer prompted.</p>

<p>"She went to the Pokémon Center." Noticing Archer's grimace, he asked, "Do you know who she is?"</p>

<p>"No, and that worries me." Archer did not elaborate further as he added, "I'll go make sure the status quo we've established in this town isn't upset."</p><hr />

<p>Kris was so damn annoyed.</p>

<p>She'd come to Azalea because it was the next gym in line, only to find the gym closed. Not closed as in the gym leader was unavailable, but the doors actually locked. Considering the gyms functioned as local League offices half of the time, and it wasn't a holiday weekend or anything, it was surprising.</p>

<p>But in a town as small as this, she figured it shouldn't be too hard to track down the gym leader. She figured the best place to ask around would be the Pokémon Center, so off she went. After all, winning another gym badge would bear testament to her qualifications as a Pokémon trainer...and consequently as a Team Rocket agent. She had not given up on this, hell no.</p>

<p>Asking the attendant nurse at the counter left Kris more questions than answers. "Well, the gym isn't taking challengers right now."</p>

<p>"But not even the office is open. Is there some kind of observance?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," said the nurse, lowering her voice, "except the gym in Goldenrod City is open."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but I'll need eight badges eventually to challenge the Elite Four. Skipping Azalea Town altogether is out of the question. Where can I find the gym leader?" Kris asked.</p>

<p>The nurse evaluated her briefly, then admitted, "I believe he went to visit Kurt. He's the man who lives beside Ilex Forest."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Kris.</p>

<p>She turned to leave but as she stepped outside of the Pokémon Center she almost ran into Archer. He smiled politely.</p>

<p>"Fancy meeting you again," he remarked, entirely amiable in his demeanor. "Kris, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and what a surprise!" Kris exclaimed, "Is your employer doing business in town?"</p>

<p>"In a sense." Archer evaded the question. "Are you going to be in Azalea long?"</p>

<p>"Just until I can challenge the Pokémon gym."</p>

<p><em>Of all the fucking...</em> He bit back his irritation.</p>

<p>"Unless anyone needs me to hang around here," she offered hopefully.</p>

<p>"Not necessary...I'm sure you have plenty to do outside of Azalea Town. Time is money, after all." Archer was thinking fast. "Why don't you go have a cup of coffee or something at the local cafeteria? I'm sure the gym leader will be back at his post pretty soon." <em>He'll get back as soon as I put a gun to his head, the asshole. Shutting the gym doors and making everything look suspicious! I'll make him throw the battle to her first, and as soon as she leaves with her badge, I'll teach him how acting unreasonable can be painful,</em> Archer thought spitefully, adding, "He goes by Bugsy – he's a specialist in bug Pokémon."</p><hr />

<p>Archer headed off contentedly, figuring Kris had taken his advice and would stay out of the way. Now all he had to do was find Bugsy, Kris would leave town, and then Team Rocket could carry on their not-so-honest but oh-so-profitable work at Slowpoke Well.</p>

<p>The Azalea gym was surrounded by beautiful rose bushes. It was small, with a pastel green roof, and at walking distance from the Pokémon Center.</p>

<p>It was such a pretty place, it hardly seemed right to threaten murder there – but of course Archer didn't give a damn about trivialities. The gym leader Bugsy had parked his car in the little parking lot and was searching through keys to unlock the gym when he caught sight of Archer and froze.</p>

<p>Archer smiled a bit maliciously as he approached. His Houndoom followed at his heels, a perfectly trained attack dog awaiting his signal.</p>

<p>"What," Archer posed acidly, "was the gym leader of Azalea Town doing away from the gym?"</p>

<p>Bugsy tried to answer, but couldn't think up an excuse before Archer seized him by the lapel of his shirt. The Houndoom was snarling, small wisps of smoke twirling a threat of flames from between bared fangs.</p>

<p>"We gave no orders to shut the gym." Archer narrowed his eyes. "Or maybe you planned to draw attention. If the Pokémon League couldn't contact their Azalea office, they'd send an inspector. I don't think all that attention would be good...do you?"</p>

<p>Fright played on the man's face. "I didn't intend to stir up anything. Honest."</p>

<p>"You've got a challenger," Archer said simply. "A girl from New Bark; she's going to win a badge here and go merrily on her way."</p>

<p>"Krystal?"</p>

<p>"You've met her, then."</p>

<p>"I told her I'd take her challenge if she'd get Kurt to return..." Bugsy trailed off realizing he said too much, and Archer hounded him further.</p>

<p>"Who is Kurt and where'd he go?"</p>

<p>"My father-in-law. Future father-in-law. You see I'm engaged to Lily, the sister of the town blacksmith..."</p>

<p>"Well then, if the town wants to see your wedding and not your funeral you'd better get to the damn point," Archer snapped.</p>

<p>"Kurt said he would go to the well and save the Slowpoke," Bugsy relented. "Please don't hurt him. He doesn't even have a Pokémon. He thinks if anyone harms the Slowpoke they'll curse the town with drought."</p>

<p>"Stay here at the gym. Don't worry at all about Kurt...worry about your own health." As he spoke, Archer made a show of examining the roses on the nearest bush but did not pick any, satisfied merely at the look of abject terror on the gym leader's face at the implication. Team Rocket had a deadly symbolism with roses; everybody knew it.</p>

<p>Bugsy followed his orders immediately, and Archer recalled Houndoom to its Poké Ball and strolled back to the well.</p>

<p>Archer found the group of Team Rocket minions racing frantically for the forest.</p>

<p>"What the—" he began to question.</p>

<p>"Let's go Archer, no time to explain!" one exclaimed, and he ran after them.</p>

<p>They came to rest in a thicket of Ilex Forest, and as the group tried to catch their breath, Archer demanded, "This is everybody we had stationed at Slowpoke Well."</p>

<p>The response from one of his subordinates was a sharp nod of the head. "The gig's up."</p>

<p>"What, the cops?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>They looked embarrassed. "Long story."</p>

<p>"We ran off like frightened Patrat; I'm going to have to explain this shit to Giovanni. I've got time."</p>

<p>Archer turned to the rest of the minions expectantly, and after a moment of fidgeting – none of them seemed very sure how to approach it – one of them tentatively stated, "Well it started when Basil came in shouting for backup."</p>

<p>Basil and Wyatt had been the posted guards. "The two of you couldn't handle whatever it was?" demanded Archer.</p>

<p>"One of us. I was there," Basil said proudly. "Wyatt went into town."</p>

<p>"I had to take a leak," Wyatt justified.</p>

<p>Archer stared at him. "I'm sorry, you couldn't just go in the bushes?"</p>

<p>"I figured I'd bring back lunch. It was like noon and we were hungry," explained Wyatt.</p>

<p>"Which by the way, you owe me either the sandwich I asked for or my money back," Basil interrupted.</p>

<p>"Okay, whatever." Archer redirected the conversation, turning back to the first minion. "Basil comes in shouting. Then what?"</p>

<p>"This old man shows up and starts telling us off about how we're hurting the sacred Slowpoke of the well and I-don't-know what else, then he loses his balance and falls into the well with us."</p>

<p>"That's why I ran for backup!" Basil said as if vindicated, only to add, "He didn't have any Pokémon with him."</p>

<p>"That should have made it easy then," presumed Archer.</p>

<p>"I mean, we didn't want to rough him up."</p>

<p>"Noooo... we might be a criminal syndicate, but that would be evil far beyond us." Archer was merciless in his sarcasm. "Anyway you said he fell down the well. Wouldn't that help your problem?"</p>

<p>"He fell on a Slowpoke."</p>

<p>"How was the Slowpoke?"</p>

<p>"Then this lady came by. She was kind of young – actually looked a lot like you, Archer; same hair color. Anyway, we figured she was there to cause trouble, 'cause she had an Eevee with her and the damn thing looked like it wanted to bite someone. She claimed she was only looking for the old man," the minion recounted.</p>

<p>"And did you give her the old man?"</p>

<p>"We sicced our Pokémon on her."</p>

<p><em>Of course you did, you dimwits,</em> Archer thought with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Her Eevee beat us," admitted the minion.</p>

<p>"She's got that Eevee really well trained," added another brightly. "Maybe we should steal it."</p>

<p>"Who's going to bell that Meowth?" quipped a third. To which descended a total hush amongst the minions.</p>

<p>Archer, who had become fed up with the story and was growing frustrated, interjected. "You know what? I changed my mind. I <em>don't</em> have time to hear this shit. Cut to the fucking chase."</p>

<p>"We were out of Pokémon. And then the villagers heard the commotion and realizing they had the upper hand they attacked with <em>their</em> Pokémon and it was a big fight..."</p>

<p>"So you decided to make for the hills," Archer deduced.</p>

<p>"The forest, but yeah," conceded the minion.</p>

<p>"And how, pray tell, do you think this makes Team Rocket look?"</p>

<p>No one answered, but everyone looked guilty. Archer cursed at them:</p>

<p>"All I do to uphold the prestige of our glorious organization and you idiots blow it. Let's head to our casino at Goldenrod City. Giovanni's going to hate this."</p><hr />

<p>Archer rather liked Goldenrod. It was the Johto region's biggest city and worth the title. Goldenrod was large enough to be full of activity and provide easy access to practically anything one sought, yet it was close enough to the grassy routes to escape the crowds if they began grating on one's nerves. Considering how long they had been working out of that rinky-dink Azalea Town, returning here was more than welcome.</p>

<p>It was nearly nightfall by the time they emerged from Ilex Forest, so the glistening neon lights of the casino were like the joyous greeting of civilization. To Team Rocket, their gambling properties were a safe haven; even their flagship casino in Celadon, of the neighbouring Kanto region, hid the syndicate's headquarters from the authorities on the basement level.</p>

<p>Archer dismissed the cadets with instructions to regroup here tomorrow afternoon, then contacted the boss on a videophone in one of the casino's private back offices.</p>

<p>All in all, Archer felt Giovanni was a good leader. Granted, some days he secretly thought he should pay less mind to the 'rules' of their business, but no one could deny that Team Rocket had become what it was today by Giovanni's own entrepreneurship, and they only continued to acquire more power under his leadership. Ensuring the preeminence of their syndicate was absolute. Besides, when it came to loyalty, Archer would never go against the family.</p>

<p>The don's purring cat Pokémon, Persian, sat watching the monitor with judgmental eyes. Persian distrusted Archer, or at least that was the impression Archer got. Archer didn't know <em>why</em> the cat had to be counselor anyway.</p>

<p>Giovanni appeared mildly curious but there was little reaction from him as Archer recounted, with select omission, the events at Slowpoke Well. Kris was neither here nor there to the matter, Archer decided. When he had told the whole tale, Giovanni gave a mixed shrug and gesture.</p>

<p>"In any case we've settled the disagreement with Seafoam Farms. James and Jessie got them to be reasonable."</p>

<p><em>Great. Now James and Jessie are looking more efficient than I am.</em> Archer forced down his envy.</p>

<p>Giovanni turned his attention to another matter, that of the Silph Company. "Silph has declined our first offer to buy out his company's assets. In your view, what would be the best course of action?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that Mr. Silph refuses to cooperate both because he underestimates our organization and because he has no need to," evaluated Archer, "So we should find a way to maneuver his company into a situation where he's forced to work with us, while simultaneously showing the extent of our influence. That said it's not the quickest approach to getting what we want. The fastest result would be to put a gun to his head."</p>

<p>Giovanni smiled to himself. "You've always been quick to act in these matters. Less forgiving."</p>

<p>"We'll probably end up at plan B anyway," Archer pointed out civilly.</p>

<p>"Maybe," explained Giovanni, "but even if Mr. Silph isn't reasonable doesn't mean we ought not to be. Patience is as invaluable in business as is willingness to act."</p>

<p>"On that note, what are our plans for when we finally take over the Poké Ball market?" asked Archer with curiosity. He had plans, if Giovanni had none.</p>

<p>Poké Ball production, as everyone there knew, was an ancient craft brought into the modern industrial age. Tree nuts called apricorns were harvested and hollowed out to form capsules; these were then outfitted inside with a device made of polished tumblestone, a common mineral with natural properties affecting mass and energy. The locking mechanism sealing the capsule was normally made of wrought iron. Nowadays large factories mass-manufactured these spherical pet carriers and they were sold commercially at a fairly inexpensive price. They worked by spatial and mass manipulation, shrinking the target down to draw it into its confines and thus allowing it to be carried about in miniature, and in the same manner restored the Pokémon to proper size when it was sent back out.</p>

<p>Modern Poké Balls had several safeguards specifically placed in their design to prevent the capture of a Pokémon already registered to another Poké Ball, and naturally to avoid the use on human beings. That was what Archer saw as key.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of potential we're overlooking," Archer went on, "we're only examining legal sales in retail. If we remove some of the safeguards placed on them by law we could easily make Poké Balls a black-market commodity, not to mention it'd make stealing Pokémon from trainers easier if we're able to snag an already caught Pokémon."</p>

<p>"It'd also open us up to scrutiny beyond the petty purview of the interregional police," Giovanni responded evenly. "Playing not with the finances but with the function of a product so instrumental in the world economy might make us a political target."</p>

<p>“Once we control the world economy we can do whatever we want.”</p>

<p>"Archer, remember we have rules in our business."</p>

<p>Archer restrained a scowl. <i>Why does he insist on sticking to rules? We're running a damned criminal syndicate; rules shouldn't be playing a part in it. Giovanni is getting soft; when he founded Team Rocket, would he have quailed at the notion?</i> He chided himself almost instantly for having conjured such heretic thoughts.</p>

<p>
  <i>No, he's the leader of our organization. He knows best...and I'll do my best to help him however I can.</i>
</p><hr />

<p>The following morning dawned cloudy. Forecasts called for sun. Archer would have thought some high-and-mighty trainer had decided to annoy a Legendary Pokémon somewhere, and it was fucking up the weather, were it not for Team Rocket's knowing there was peace; keeping track of anything that could interfere with their business was important for a syndicate of such extensive territory.</p>

<p>He decided to go out for a walk; there was nothing particularly better to do.</p>

<p>Three blocks down from the casino, in an out-of-the-way place hidden from view, was the entrance to the Goldenrod underground. The underground was a long pathway stretching across the length of the city, with a flea market of vendors and plenty of shadowy nooks and crannies that were the domain of less honest businesses. Here was one of many places where the stolen Pokémon and illicit merchandise Team Rocket traded in reached the black market. This said, the main path was as honest as ever, and no one ever really found out about Goldenrod's seedier side unless they explored those narrow side corridors to see where they led, so the underground was bustling with both salespeople and locals haggling over wares.</p>

<p>Archer did not expect to meet Kris again, let alone here. He said so.</p>

<p>She dipped her head regretfully. "I wanted to apologize."</p>

<p>"Apologize?" Archer echoed.</p>

<p>"For Eevee beating up your employees."</p>

<p>
<em>I'm going to have to do something about this girl. I don't know what yet. I'll have to think about it.</em>
</p>

<p>"We didn't mess up your investments too much, did we?" she asked with concern.</p>

<p>"It's nothing the company can't weather." Archer tried to hide the resentful sting in his voice, and he changed the topic. "Are you here to buy an evolution stone for your Eevee?"</p>

<p>"Actually, I was thinking about letting it evolve into either an Espeon or an Umbreon. I know that's leaving it up to when Eevee wants to evolve, though. Oh...that reminds me! Do you know where the herbal medicine vendor is?"</p>

<p>"You're buying herbal medicine?" Archer asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"For our upcoming gym battle," explained Kris. "It's supposed to be much cheaper than potions."</p>

<p>He shook his head in exasperation. "Everyone knows that Eevee only evolve by themselves if they're happy, and they get <em>unhappy</em> if you feed them bitter things. Spend the extra money on potions now; consider it an investment. After the Eevee evolves you can feed it whatever you like because it won't matter then."</p>

<p>"You mean evolved Eevee don't mind bitter things?"</p>

<p>"No, it won't matter if your Pokémon gets upset afterwards because its already evolved. What's it going to do? Sulk?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, but I don't want my Pokémon unhappy. I want it to like me."</p>

<p>"You're not cut out to be a Team Rocket agent," Archer sneered. "You worry too much about your Pokémon's feelings, damn it. Look, I thought you said you had a gym to challenge."</p>

<p>"The gym here in Goldenrod," affirmed Kris. "I don't remember the gym leader's name..."</p>

<p>"Whitney."</p>

<p>"That's her. Everyone says she's the strongest gym leader in all of Johto."</p>

<p>"That's because of the cow."</p>

<p>"The cow...?" Kris' eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Afraid so," replied Archer, without elaboration. "I'll see you around."</p>

<p>"But I want to know about the cow."</p>

<p>"You'll find out about that when you meet Whitney. Now if you want your Eevee to evolve, my advice is spoil it rotten and buy it sweet things until it gets fed up with all the sugar and evolves. <em>Arrivederci</em>, Kris."</p><hr />

<p>Archer returned to the casino when it was around one in the afternoon, where the minions were congregating to be briefed as to their next mission. On a lark he decided to check that everyone was accounted for. Unsurprisingly, he discovered that minions were missing.</p>

<p>"Where's Eddie?" demanded Archer.</p>

<p>"Out on the wharf. He said he'd be by shortly," said one of the minions.</p>

<p>"The boss doesn't pay people to be AWOL."</p>

<p>In the midst of this two others, Leroy and Jasmine, hurried over. They seemed out of breath.</p>

<p>"Where were you?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>"We were late."</p>

<p>"I can see that for myself."</p>

<p>"We got lost in the department store."</p>

<p>Archer didn't believe them for a minute. <em>Those two are worse than Jessie and James. No, wait...Jessie and James had that incident at the restaurant. That was way worse. Lay blame where blame is due.</em></p>

<p>The rest of the minions were either more trusting or more willing to help them cover up. Or conversely they wanted to help get them into trouble. It was hard to tell. "Did you see they were having a rooftop sale?"</p>

<p>"Umm. No," replied Leroy, fidgeting.</p>

<p>"I saw it!" remarked one of the others. "I was by there earlier. They had all sorts of goodies at half the price off, and these cute little hats..."</p>

<p>"Did they have Lava Cookies?" asked yet another.</p>

<p>"What the fuck, Lava Cookies? You know they only sell those in Hoenn."</p>

<p>"They're delicious. You know they really oughta expand their business."</p>

<p>"Why don't you just have them mailed to Kanto?"</p>

<p>"Are you kidding. For ten dollars shipping? That's like the price of three boxes of cookies."</p>

<p>"We should take over the cookie market. How come Team Rocket doesn't have any interest in that?"</p>

<p>"There's no profit in it."</p>

<p>"I'd pay good money for a box of cookies."</p>

<p>"But not ten dollars shipping?"</p>

<p>"Basil, fuck you."</p>

<p>They were going off on a tangent again. Archer frowned; sometimes Pokémon were easier to control than people. "No one gives a shit about the cookies. Since we're all here, except Eddie, we can get started."</p>

<p>Right on cue, Eddie showed up. "Eddie we thought a wild Pokémon had gotten you," someone exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I was by the radio tower. Have you guys seen the place? They've got this big ass antenna."</p>

<p>"It's a radio station. They're supposed to have an antenna."</p>

<p>"No but this is a real big one. I heard it can reach all across the region."</p>

<p>"What, the antenna?"</p>

<p>"No the programs."</p>

<p>"Aren't they going to have a new show starting next week with Professor Oak?"</p>

<p>Archer wondered if the other elite duos of Team Rocket had this many problems with their subordinates. If they did, it was a grievous disaster for their organization to be beset by so many idiots. If they didn't, then this was a failing on his part and he had better do something to remedy it.</p>

<p>He reminded himself they were still trainees. He then reminded himself they were the future of their organization and berated himself again.</p>

<p>In the middle of this catastrophe Eddie added, "By the way, you remember the girl with the Eevee? She's here at the casino."</p>

<p><em>Why can't she fucking go away?</em> "I'll deal with it," Archer said.</p>

<p>Archer met Kris on the casino floor; she held her pet Eevee as usual, and stood watching one of the roulette wheels. He wasn't surprised anymore by her appearances, but he was still unsure whether her tenacity was a good thing or a bad thing.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kris. We cross paths a lot," he prodded, emphasizing the point.</p>

<p>He motioned her aside, and they stepped over to the side of the floor, where there were a few decorative vases filled with red roses but not much else.</p>

<p>Her vivacity returned in full force as she showed off her Pokémon. "By the way, I took your advice and I'm feeding Eevee sugary things."</p>

<p>The Eevee had flat ears and a cookie clutched in its jaws. It growled when Archer got too near the cookie.</p>

<p>Archer looked skeptical. "How much sugar did you feed it, a whole bag?"</p>

<p>"Whitney was impressed. She said she'd never seen such a hyper Eevee," said Kris proudly. "Incidentally we won the gym battle!"</p>

<p>At that moment a small detachment of their minions walked by.</p>

<p>Even in civilian attire, they and Kris evidently recognized each other from having battled at the Slowpoke Well. Any animosity the minions had however, went right out the window when they laid eyes on what Eevee had.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, is that a Lava Cookie?" exclaimed one of the minions.</p>

<p>"Yes, they had them on sale at the department store," said Kris. "I got them for like 25 percent off."</p>

<p>"No shit?" They now glowered with accusation at one in the middle of their group, who shrank sheepishly. "You told us they didn't have any Lava Cookies, you miser. What're you trying to do, hoard them?"</p>

<p>"I bought the last five boxes," admitted Kris.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here anyway?" asked one quizzical minion.</p>

<p>"Eevee and I are trying to join the team," Kris said cheerily.</p>

<p>The minions looked at each other, then at Archer. "We should let her join."</p>

<p>"What the hell?" Archer snapped.</p>

<p>"She has the last five boxes of cookies."</p>

<p>A single glare from Archer made them wince and hush instantly.</p>

<p>When the group left, he turned back to face Kris. She seemed as resolutely hopeful as ever.</p>

<p>"Well, you seem to have gotten the seal of approval from some of our employees." Archer observed mildly. "As I said, Kris...I don't handle personnel matters."</p>

<p>She looked a little disappointed. He still wasn't sure what to make of her.</p>

<p>"Tell you what," he said, smoothly. "Meet me at Ecruteak City. I'll have a little test. Depending on how you do, I <em>might</em> pass your name along to the boss."</p>

<p>"Really?!" exclaimed Kris.</p>

<p>"Might," Archer emphasized, "I'll expect you near the garden beside the Tin Tower."</p>

<p>Autumn's crisp chill reigned across the Kanto region, and the trees were just beginning to have their leaves edged by fiery gold. The rain had tapered off by midday, which meant more people were out and about.</p>

<p>An outdoor market had set up near the city's central plaza, selling everything from seasonal berries to fall attire, and Jessie and James were perusing the wares. Granted, it was mostly Jessie, but James would not have dreamt of spoiling her joy.</p>

<p>So far she had bought plenty of items for both herself and James. Meowth, ever-mindful that the average Pokémon did not speak in human language, waited till no one was paying attention to the three of them before purring, "How 'bout something for Me-owth?"</p>

<p>"Let's see what they've got," Jessie remarked, as she passed another bundle of purchases over to James to hold. "...oh, look! Perfect."</p>

<p>It was a tiny orange sweater made of dyed Wooloo wool, sized perfectly for a small Pokémon. Jessie held it up, glancing at her two companions with a mischievous look.</p>

<p>James laughed. "He'll never put up with that."</p>

<p>"You got that right," hissed Meowth, with his ears lying flat.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd accept a bribe," replied Jessie slyly, directing his attention to a basket full of yarn balls.</p>

<p>If there was one thing Meowth went wild over, it was yarn. They once found him attacking the tassel of a curtain – he tried saying it attacked him first, but they knew better – and once when a string had started unravelling from a knit blanket he had succeeded in wresting it free and consolidating it into a ball so he could roll it up and down their apartment. The moment Meowth saw the yarn, his eyes lit up with excitement. Then, he proceeded to give another emphatic hiss.</p>

<p>"That's not a bribe, that's blackmail," growled the cat.</p>

<p>Jessie grinned yet accordingly put aside the sweater in favor of buying the yarn ball. Meowth gave an approving purr.</p>

<p>James' transceiver phone rang, and the playful mood quieted when they saw it was Giovanni. The trio stepped away from the market before answering.</p>

<p>"Do you recall the Charizard you acquired on your trip to Galar?" Giovanni asked them.</p>

<p>"Yes." How could they forget? It was now Team Rocket's, but it once belonged to such a high-profile trainer as the Galar region's undefeated champion; well...undefeated till they showed up, anyway. His funeral had been televised.</p>

<p>"The Charizard is missing," said Giovanni bluntly.</p>

<p>"How can that be?" wondered James.</p>

<p>"There's no way an outsider could have gotten access to our private menagerie, which means one of our own men was inept enough to let it escape, and untrustworthy enough to try to take it to begin with. We'll have to find out who... but first, I need you two to get the Pokémon back."</p><hr />

<p>Ash had good progress since leaving Pallet Town.</p>

<p>He'd passed by Viridian, but only long enough to see that the gym leader was briefly out and, a bit too impatient to wait till he returned, decided to continue on to Pewter City. There he'd defeated the gym leader Brock and, with his first League badge in hand, proceeded happily on the way to Mount Moon and the next city over.</p>

<p>"We had a stroke of good luck, wouldn't you say, Pikachu?" he remarked to his Pokémon as they strolled down the path. "Managing to defeat a rock type with a critical hit on Quick Attack! You did great."</p>

<p>"<i>Pikaaa!</i>" squeaked Pikachu, but it was less in reply and more as an alert. Ash glanced up to what Pikachu had noticed and stopped abruptly when he spied the Charizard sprawled on the grass.</p>

<p>It was an imposing dragon taller than the height of a man, with powerful wings, orange scales over a muscular hide, and a long neck ending in a finely crocodilian maw of sharp fangs. Its tapered tail was plumed with flame, and it was on this fire Ash's sight lingered. A Charizard's health could be measured by the strength of its tail-flame. This one appeared to be going out.</p>

<p>"You don't look so good," he murmured.</p>

<p>Ash reached towards the dragon gingerly, but it roared and snapped at him causing him to pull back instantly.</p>

<p>Pikachu gave a few shrill, angry chirps, to which the Charizard gave a grumbling growl back without any vigour. Despite its show of bravado, it was shivering; in any other creature it would have been concerning, but for a fire type this was an absolute emergency.</p>

<p>
<i>That's certainly not a good sign. A fire Pokémon can never be cold.</i>
</p>

<p>A sense of pity washed over him for this powerful creature on the verge of death, and he determined to try to save it. The easiest way to transport animals was, obviously, by carrying them in Poké Balls, and this Charizard was in no condition to break free from one either. When Ash tossed one of the capsules at it however, the opening glow of energy dissipated before the dragon could even be drawn inside.</p>

<p>Poké Balls tied to the genetic pattern of an individual animal, and each one was registered to a trainer's identification; if a Poké Ball would not work it meant only one thing.</p>

<p>"It must already have a trainer," Ash realized.</p>

<p>Wherever its trainer was, however, was nowhere around here. Finding no sign of them, he sat on the grass and rummaged through his backpack, finally pulling out a piece of stationery. The Charizard eyed Ash distrustfully as he wrote out a note and handed it to Pikachu; his pet seized it in its mouth.</p>

<p>"Pikachu," said Ash, "take this to the nearest Pokémon Center. Hurry back!"</p>

<p>With a muffled but resolute squeak, Pikachu darted away.</p>

<p>An hour later, some people came from the Pokémon Center and the Charizard was accordingly transported and hurried into emergency care. Pokémon Centers were a combination of veterinary clinics and traveller rest stops. It was a simple matter with their advanced medicine to heal minor injuries swiftly, and nowadays modern inventions yielded a way to heal severe ones too.</p>

<p>Ash followed and lingered in the lobby. Before long a nurse emerged with an update.</p>

<p>"The Charizard will be fine," she said, "We just need to locate his trainer now."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," replied Ash. Beside him, Pikachu gave a series of squeaks.</p>

<p>Ash turned to the little Pokémon. "Really, Pikachu?" he asked happily. The nurse realized there was actual comprehension in his eyes as he listened to Pikachu's adamant squeaks and chirps.</p>

<p>"You can understand your Pokémon?" she observed with surprise.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with almost self-conscious humility, "He's been my friend for so long I just kind of learnt his language. When I was much younger I did something everyone knows not to do...I wandered out into the tall grass without a Pokémon for protection. A Fearow attacked me and as I was trying to fight it off, a wild Pikachu jumped into the fray and scared the Fearow. He sorta latched on and followed me home. I've had him ever since."</p>

<p>"So your Pokémon chose you."</p>

<p>"I guess you could say that," Ash laughed, petting Pikachu.</p>

<p>Before they could say anything more, the glass doors at the entrance slid open and a man and a woman strode in and headed to the reception desk. They were in their mid-twenties, dressed in business attire. A Meowth accompanied them at their heels.</p>

<p>"May I help you?" asked the nurse.</p>

<p>"Yes..." said the woman, "Someone told me you found a injured Charizard? That's our lost Pokémon."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the clerk, "Charizard was found and brought in by this trainer here. It's being tended to and is going to be alright."</p>

<p>As she went to the back of the place, the man addressed the woman. "Jessie, I think we should immediately take it to the boss...not stay around for dinner."</p>

<p>"Of course, James," was the reply, "I know how interested he is in this."</p>

<p>Meowth meanwhile entwined around their ankles. It seemed to be keeping an eye on everything, especially Ash's pet Pikachu.</p>

<p>Ash in turn observed the couple and their cat silently, but when the Charizard was brought out it was evident the dragon did not seem content to see them. It outstretched its wings and lifted its head with a threatening roar, only to be unceremoniously drawn into its Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"You need to know, your Pokémon is still very weak," said the nurse, "It was severely injured and needs more time to recover."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Ash, allowing curiosity to get the better of him, "your Charizard looks so familiar. Did you ever enter him in a televised battle anywhere?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," replied James.</p>

<p>The nurse, however, still seemed worried about releasing the creature while it was still recovering. "Please reconsider taking the Pokémon so soon... Another day of rest is all it might need."</p>

<p>"We're taking our property, <i>now</i>," said Jessie emphatically, then added, "You can reach us at our employer's line."</p>

<p>"Who is your employer?" asked the nurse.</p>

<p>"Rocket Enterprises," answered Jessie.</p>

<p>There was an instant change in everyone's demeanour.</p>

<p>James turned to Ash, locked eyes with him, and said, "You need to learn when <i>not</i> to ask questions. It's healthier that way."</p>

<p>Ash tensed, but neither Jessie nor James bothered to wait for a response. They walked away with the Poké Ball; Ash watched them fixedly and their Meowth growled perceptively at him and arched its back.</p>

<p>This attitude annoyed Pikachu, who responded with snapping sparks and a battle stance.</p>

<p>Before anyone knew what had happened, Pikachu launched itself at Meowth. The cat let out a screech as the two animals ended up in a fighting ball of fur, and Jessie, James, and Ash all raced after them in sudden unison as their Pokémon tumbled outside.</p>

<p>"Pikachu stop that!" Ash protested.</p>

<p>Instead, Pikachu let out a flare of electrical arcs. The electricity not only hit its opponent squarely, it also struck both Jessie and James inadvertently as they tried to pull Meowth away from Pikachu, and the force threw the three of them backwards against the grass.</p>

<p>Pikachu poised in a battle stance and gave a couple of firm squeaks, only backing down when Ash bent down to pick it up and hug it. Jessie and James were dusting themselves off as Ash translated:</p>

<p>"Pikachu says that Charizard didn't want to go with you because you're not treating it well."</p>

<p>"Listen twerp," replied Jessie, "There are only two groups of people – those who are in Team Rocket, and those who keep their mouth shut."</p>

<p>"What about a group opposing Team Rocket?" Ash pursued defiantly.</p>

<p>James sneered. "Anyone who opposes Team Rocket ends up buried."</p>

<p>The bluntness of their words struck him jarringly. Yet instead of fear, what Ash felt was ire. Did they really think they could harm Pokémon as they pleased, for no reason, with impunity?</p>

<p>"You should hope we don't come across you again," Jessie threatened calmly.</p>

<p>"It won't be a nice day for you," added James.</p>

<p>"<i>Mrrrow</i>," came a distinct rumble from Meowth's throat.</p>

<p>As they walked away, Pikachu turned to Ash with drooping ears but said nothing else as it clambered onto his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I guess we ought to get going," Ash said, and Pikachu gave a little growl.</p><hr />

<p>Viridian City was bustling with activity. People were heading outside to enjoy the sudden burst of sunshine on that now-clear fall afternoon.</p>

<p>Delia was out as well, grocery shopping for something in particular. She walked into one of the many shops on Central Street and searched for apple butter, which was a seasonal favorite for her to use as a spread on her morning toast, however to her dismay she found none.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," she directed herself to a store attendant, "Where do you keep the apple butter?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry ma'am, we've run out."</p>

<p>"Oh..." she felt a sudden pang of sadness, "All I need is one jar. Would you see if you have any in stock in the back, please?"</p>

<p>"One moment," was the curt reply.</p>

<p>The clerk left and returned quickly, "I'm sorry madam but all the previous customers have purchased all we had on the shelves and in stock. We have no apple butter."</p>

<p>Her face showed her disappointment and the clerk apologized again, as she walked out the door and bumped into Jessie and James.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she said.</p>

<p>The couple recognized her immediately as well as noticing her sad countenance.</p>

<p>"No problem miss," said Jessie, "I hope you don't mind my prying...you look a bit upset..."</p>

<p>"Well, it's just a silly thing...the store informed me they're out of apple butter and I've been to other places in search of, to no avail."</p>

<p>Jessie glanced at James. "Have you tried the store next door?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet; that's my last hope. I think I won't be able to have my favorite breakfast," she replied with relent. Having said this, she walked into the other store.</p>

<p>"Do it guys," Meowth hissed, "Fast. The boss will appreciate it; after all, they <i>are</i> paying us for protection."</p>

<p>"Right on it," said James as he pulled a phone out of his pocket.</p>

<p>The call was answered quickly by Giovanni.</p>

<p>"Have you retrieved the Charizard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes sir, we were on our way to bring it to you when we met up with Miss Ketchum. She's shopping for an item...apple butter...she has been told no at one of our client establishments."</p>

<p>Giovanni frowned. "Get her the apple butter. You know how I expect it done."</p>

<p>"Yes sir." They hung up and looking at Jessie, James tipped his head towards the store. They walked in, and within minutes walked back out and saw Delia coming out of the neighboring store.</p>

<p>"Any luck miss?" James asked her.</p>

<p>"No. I guess everyone got here before me, there seems to be a shortage for some reason," she answered.</p>

<p>"Well, come into this store," Jessie told her, "We spoke with the manager and it seems they do have apple butter."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Come on," Jessie beckoned, ignoring the question.</p>

<p>They all entered the store where Delia had previously been, and while the clerk went to the back room quickly, the manager came and walked up to shake Delia's hand.</p>

<p>"My immense apologies, miss," he said, nervously, "it has come to my attention that you have been shopping for apple butter...my clerk was unaware that we were receiving a new shipment today."</p>

<p>As if on cue, the clerk came back with two jars of apple butter, put them in a bag and handed it to his manager, who in turn gave it to Delia. Jessie and James looked on approvingly as Meowth purred.</p>

<p>"That is wonderful!" Delia exclaimed. "I must thank the two of you," she said turning to the Team Rocket duo, "for helping me."</p>

<p>They didn't answer, but simply smiled.</p>

<p>Delia looked in the bag and said, "I only need one jar, really...how much is the cost?"</p>

<p>"It's on the house," the manager hurried to say, "take it with our compliments, and with the hopes that you will come to shop here again."</p>

<p>Delia was momentarily silent, then replied, "Thank you, much."</p>

<p>The manager simply dipped his head in respect but said nothing.</p>

<p>Delia turned and walked out followed by James, Jessie and the cat.</p>

<p>Outside, she turned to the trio again and said, "I don't know your names but I hope all your actions are richly rewarded."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Jessie answered, "Enjoy the apple butter."</p>

<p>The trio turned and walked away, avoiding any more conversation. Delia observed them as she thought things over, and then she turned in the opposite direction, boarded a city bus and went home.</p>

<p>When the Team Rocket trio were at a distance, Meowth piped up and said, "She's probably wondering how we managed it..."</p>

<p>"Well, most people aren't aware how our business works," answered James, "the store owner pays Rocket Enterprises for security services we persuade them to need, a.k.a. 'protection'..."</p>

<p>"...and now they are beholden to us," added Jessie slyly, "since they typically go into arrears in their payments."</p>

<p>"The debt is always collected," finished Meowth, "as the boss says... 'cash, assets or blood.' "</p>

<p>They all laughed; and headed towards Giovanni's office with the Poké Ball containing the Charizard.</p><hr />

<p>Ecruteak's historical garden was a scenic and well-kept landscape, imbued with tradition of bygone years, with willow trees that cascaded their branches beautifully to the freshwater pond and the ancient pagoda-like temple known as the Tin Tower as a backdrop. Monks managed both the garden and the Tin Tower, which was considered sacred in Johto.</p>

<p>Close by was an even older tower, which had been destroyed in a fire. Archer figured it was the truest symbol of Ecruteak, and of many things in the world beside.</p>

<p>"The city of nostalgia. All that really means is it's the city of forlorn memories," Archer mused to himself.</p>

<p>He was not one to diminish such things however. Sometimes he thought too much of the past and living up to its aspirations; Team Rocket could not afford anything less than perfection in glory when the costs had been so high, and sometimes that meant even more expenditures. It was a cost-sunk fallacy in human lives. Not that Archer would ever acknowledge it.</p>

<p>He was reflecting on the towers when Kris hurried over to meet him. <em>Right on schedule.</em></p>

<p>He motioned for her to follow him, and as they leisurely made their way towards the Burnt Tower, Archer asked, "How familiar are you with Johto mythology?"</p>

<p>"Only the basics," Kris admitted.</p>

<p>Archer told her the legend:</p>

<p>"They say long ago the tower used to be the roost of a legendary bird Pokémon known as a Ho-oh; however, the tower caught fire.</p>

<p>"How it happened became lost to history. Some people say it was a lightning storm. Others say it was during ancient wartime. For all we know a Charmander's tail got too close to a cask of rum. How it happened is beside the point.</p>

<p>"Three Pokémon perished in the blaze. They say Ho-oh revived them before it flew off, in the process sealing them into a deep slumber, and they wait somewhere for a chosen one to awaken them. You know, the typical kind of fantastical lore you hear in fairy-tales."</p>

<p>Completing the story, Archer turned expectantly to Kris. She stood straightly.</p>

<p>"You'll want me to catch the Legendary Pokémon?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What Legendary Pokémon? As I said, it's a fairy-tale. All you have to do is show you're nimble enough to maneuver around the debris and rubble."</p>

<p>"And then you'll let me into Team Rocket?" Kris prodded eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well...it's a start." Archer evaded her question as he went on, "Incidentally, the Burnt Tower is supposedly off-limits because it was deemed unsafe." His eyes glinted. "The floorboards are ancient and riddled with fire damage. But it's nothing too difficult for a member of Team Rocket. I'll be at a distance behind you judging how you do."</p>

<p>The Burnt Tower was indeed a fitting gauntlet. Charred boulders and blackened shards of wood littered what once upon a time must have been an impressive foyer. As Kris stepped gingerly ahead, Archer fell back observing her.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long for her misstep; the floorboards gave way under her weight and came crashing down, and with a cry Kris plummeted to the basement level.</p>

<p>Archer stood at the precipice and gazed down. Seeing the outline of movement in the dark depths, he laid his hand over his face with disapproval.</p>

<p>"What are you doing falling into a hole?"</p>

<p>"I must've stepped on a weak plank of wood."</p>

<p>"Well, get out of there."</p>

<p>Kris groaned as she stumbled to her feet, feeling bruised from her fall. She was cursing how ungainly she must look when she caught sight of something on a pedestal only a few paces away. There were three large figures of stone, depictions of creatures that vaguely resembled a lion, a tiger, and a leopard.</p>

<p>"Look at this."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything," Archer replied. "It's too dark."</p>

<p>Curiosity brought her closer to the pedestal, and she did little beyond outstretch an arm towards the statues when suddenly a bright flare made her leap back.</p>

<p>As she watched, the stone crumbled away in brilliant white light. Where the three statues had once stood were now three live animals, released from their prison of stone.</p>

<p>The tiger's roar was like the boom of thunder, and its striped fur shimmered like electricity; the lion's was like the explosive eruption of a volcano, with a pelt that glowed as if tipped with flame. In unified exclamation, as if elated with their freedom, they bolted.</p>

<p>The leopard was the one to linger, as if it had taken an interest in the awed trainer. This was the most beautiful creature she'd ever seen, with fur like iridescent crystal and an aquamarine crown of horns; it enveloped itself with a sparkling mist of raindrops, and moved with surprising lightness. It threw back its head in a roar more like the high-pitched singsong of the wind, dancing about Kris in a circle, and with another joyous cry leapt out of the pit in a single bound.</p>

<p>Archer nearly lost his balance when the trio of Pokémon raced by him, faster than any animals he had ever witnessed: Entei the lion, Raikou the tiger, and Suicune the leopard.</p>

<p>Right behind them was Kris, cheering ecstatically as she clambered out of the pit. "Did you see them, Archer? Three Legendary Pokémon! Good thing I fell down that hole!"</p>

<p>"You were very lucky." <em>Actually, this might be lucky for all of us. Wait till Giovanni hears about this.</em></p><hr />

<p>Archer called Giovanni via videophone to inform him but found him less enthusiastic than he had hoped.</p>

<p>"So three more Legendary Pokémon now roam the planet," said Giovanni with a slight shrug, "If they're nomads, tracking them for a hunt will be expensive. Our resources would be better served elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But godfather..." Archer ventured, "isn't one of Team Rocket's goals to harness strong Pokémon? An organization can always use more power after all."</p>

<p>"Catch them if you can. Don't waste our capital on it."</p>

<p>Archer stayed silent, though he was in disagreement.</p>

<p>"If we're going to spend money on a hunt then we may as well hunt the most powerful Pokémon of all. Catching a Pokémon of that caliber first will make it easier to catch the rest as well if we then decide to."</p>

<p>The 'most powerful Pokémon of all', reflected Archer, was said to be extinct. Yes, they had heard rumors of such a creature surviving somewhere, yet nothing concrete.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow is Saturday," Giovanni mentioned. "You can take the rest of the weekend off before heading to Mahogany Town."</p>

<p>
<em>Mahogany Town?<em> Archer thought. </em>Oh no, not another itty bitty village.</em>
</p>

<p>"You're aware of our side project into Pokémon genetics."</p>

<p>"Yes, godfather," answered Archer. "It's run out of Cinnabar Island, isn't it?" <em>Send me to Cinnabar instead. I don't care about the others; leave them here.</em></p>

<p>"Yes, but we're temporarily doing some tests away from Cinnabar."</p>

<p>
<em>Damn it.</em>
</p>

<p>"The experiment they need to run would attract too much attention there," explained Giovanni. "Dr. Colress is assisting us with his valuable research... he will be at our Mahogany base and will fill you in on what is needed."</p>

<p>Archer nodded obediently, and Giovanni hung up.</p>

<p>Mayor Evice S. Cade brushed the sweat away from his brow as he smiled to his political supporters gathered for the opening ceremony, pretending the Orrean sun was not so blisteringly hot and there was at least some relief of warm wind coming off of the desert. What he wouldn't have given for the refreshing breezes of Johto, which came off the mountain peaks and descended into peaceful, tree-filled towns.</p>

<p>He'd last been there – how many years ago, now?</p>

<p>Beside him stood Linford Rose and his wife Oleana, two Galarian transplants who owned a fortune in Orrean diamond mines. They were at their heart financial backers, not political ones, but where the two interests merged it followed that there should be some necessary crossover. And someone like Cade saw no difference in either finance <i>or</i> politics when it benefitted him somehow.</p>

<p>"Do you have the time...?" Cade asked Rose in a whisper. "I think it should've been over by now."</p>

<p>Rose glanced inconspicuously at the gold watch on his wrist. "The event's almost over," he answered in the same quiet tone.</p>

<p>"Thanks," murmured Cade, feigning another smile for the public.</p>

<p>Affability was Cade's cultivated image. The mayor of Phenac City was all smiles and helpfulness wherever he could be. In appearance he was unexceptional, about fifty, with a receding hairline turned grey with age and eyes turned clever by experience. Whereas Rose had once upon a time sought the pomp and pride of regional fame, Cade instead sought the charming demureness of a neighbor, someone who could be spoken of highly by civic clubs as an ideal citizen but who was never truly known in depth.</p>

<p>Phenac City, in his care, was pristine. It was one of the few cities of the Orre region that was a manmade oasis. Streams and cascades of glistening freshwater wove through Phenac and its sandstone streets, always bringing a coolness to the otherwise sweltering atmosphere. Cade, as its mayor, made sure it stood out as crime-free in comparison to the rest of dry and inhospitable Orre. Long forsaken by investors, the region had dwindling property values; even Pokémon had gone extinct in the wild, so Cade's tourism promotion was limited in efficacy until Mr. Rose arrived.</p>

<p>As the ceremony dragged on, Cade was becoming bored. He focused on the people around him instead of the long, monotonous speech being read; he found himself noticing Oleana, drawn as usual to the fine way of her motions.</p>

<p>Cade envied Mr. Rose greatly. Oleana's long blonde hair fell below her shoulders, accentuating a slender silhouette both tall and limber; painted eyes and lips and a coldly no-nonsense demeanor that Cade fancied held a streak of hot flame in private...</p>

<p>He forced himself to glance away.</p>

<p>Beside Oleana stood a Glaceon, an ice type Eevee evolution that was one of her Pokémon. Between her and her husband Oleana had the most Pokémon, numbering four, and occasionally expressed interest in getting a fifth, which in Orre meant having to buy one. Rose joked that it wouldn't be long before she had a full team of six like the Elite Four of most regions. Then again Cade wondered how serious she was about it, because with money like the Roses had they could afford a whole ranch.</p>

<p>The ribbon-cutting ceremony marked the culmination of a revitalization effort uniting city taxpayer funds with Mr. Rose's philanthropy, all for a combination casino-hotel-colosseum professed to one day be the grandest entertainment destination not only in all Orre but in all the world. Artist renderings depicted a lofty skyscraper of glass and gold, with the Pokémon stadium at the very top. Now hewn into reality, it was nothing short of magnificent.</p>

<p><i>Most important of all...there would be air conditioning,</i> thought Cade. Despite not being far from where the present event was held, Phenac's cooler climate was far enough to make him long to return.</p>

<p>He picked up Glaceon and put the animal on his lap. Coolness radiated off the Pokémon, enveloping him as if he were in front of an open freezer. Glaceon flattened its ears, annoyed at being grabbed.</p>

<p>As the event concluded, Oleana scooped up her Glaceon, as Cade forced back a scowl.</p>

<p>"You're not going to stick around for the festivities?" he asked amicably.</p>

<p>"The truth is we have a lot to do back at Agate Town," Rose excused. The Glaceon, meanwhile, had started wriggling for Oleana to put it down.</p>

<p>"A pity," Cade replied. He half-watched Oleana as she obliged Glaceon by placing it on the ground, whereupon the creature immediately poked its Poké Ball open with its nose and vanished into its little sanctuary. "I was hoping we'd get to show off Zacian and Zamazenta in our opening match."</p>

<p>Zacian and Zamazenta were the Galar region's Legendary wolf Pokémon, two mighty steel types, of which Oleana was the trainer. It was exceptionally rare for anyone to own a Legendary Pokémon, and the fact providence had granted her two was astounding. Cade had already seen the creatures in person; he saw them frequently, in fact, whenever he paid a social visit to the Roses, but he'd only seen them in battle once.</p>

<p>Oleana reminded him of that accordingly. "You've seen them in a fight already. Remember the tournament in Orre's historical colosseum?"</p>

<p>"Of course. That's exactly why I think they'd be superb at Realgam Tower," Cade responded. "They swept through their opponents without even a struggle."</p>

<p>"Precisely why I'm reluctant to enter them in the colosseum match here."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair to our opponent. There would be no challenge."</p>

<p>But all Pokémon by nature became restless without battling, even those as magnificent as Legendary Pokémon, and Oleana added clarifyingly, "Perhaps if they express motivation to fight at a later time."</p>

<p>He watched Rose and Oleana as they got into their limousine to depart for home. Their main residence was in Agate Town, a village on the opposite side of Orre that was a fairly long drive from here on the highway, but they owned property in Phenac too. It was then that Cade's transceiver phone rang. He glanced at the caller identification before answering.</p>

<p>"Mr. Silph, I didn't expect to hear from you this fine morning," said Cade, his polite alternative to asking <i>What the fuck do you want?</i></p>

<p>"Cade, we have a slight upset." Silph sounded uneasy, which only made Cade leery, "Giovanni wants to buy us out in the Poké Ball market."</p>

<p>"Don't sell to him," Cade said.</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>"It'll be more profitable for you to not sell," Cade added, "How much do we pay you to manufacture and send us those modified Poké Balls?"</p>

<p>"You don't have to convince me about that," Silph replied, "a single shipment easily earns about triple what I'd get from a corporate buyout. But what if he finds out about our business deal?"</p>

<p>"So what? Silph, what can he do?"</p>

<p>"What can he <i>do</i>?" echoed Silph incredulously, "Cade, you're living in a dreamland. Everyone here in Kanto knows what Team Rocket is capable of."</p>

<p>"Cipher isn't exactly defenseless. In many ways we're more dangerous than Team Rocket," replied Cade calmly. "You have no need to worry about them."</p>

<p>"If you're sure..."</p>

<p>"When did he contact you?"</p>

<p>"A few days ago. I haven't heard anything from Giovanni since, and I've been getting very concerned what he might intend on doing."</p>

<p>"I'll run the situation past Mr. Rose. Keep me notified and <i>don't sell</i>," Cade emphasized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the limousine of Mr. and Mrs. Rose was on the highway. Whenever they went travelling, it was easy for them to notice how Orre was mostly desert, an unyielding, parched landscape so different from the region they had once called home.</p>

<p>"We've come a long way since the unfortunate incidents in the Galar region," reflected Mr. Rose, as he watched the sandy dunes swipe by the limousine window on the drive back to Agate Town, "I still can't fathom how easily we ended up being fooled. But that's all the past...The future is ours."</p>

<p>Oleana laid a hand on his. "We've remade our fortune here in Orre. Maybe it's time to let it go. We don't need to regain our old company, Macro Cosmos."</p>

<p>"It's not about Macro Cosmos." Rose was adamant, and he went on bitterly:</p>

<p>"Team Rocket took everything we built and achieved in Galar from us, and they did so through trickery. They will pay for it. It's time Giovanni accrues a few losses."</p><hr />

<p>Following the incident at Mount Moon with the Charizard, things had gone uneventfully for Ash.</p>

<p>The gym at Cerulean, the city on the other side of Mount Moon, specialized in water types. That was Pikachu's forté, and they won with ease. His journey, all in all, had been going far more smoothly than he had imagined it would have; granted, he had been winning by luck not by skill, but with two badges to his name it hardly made a difference.</p>

<p>Ash and Pikachu had tried to go straight to Saffron City after having triumphed at the Cerulean gym, only to encounter the city gates blocked and a man attired in the black uniform of a Team Rocket minion, demanding a toll. Ash refused to pay the toll, which he said was literally highway robbery, so they detoured via the underpass – an underground pedestrian walkway that connected the cities of Cerulean, Celadon, and Vermillion. Ash arrived at Vermillion City by midday.</p>

<p>Known as "The Port of Exquisite Sunsets", Vermillion was a harbor town with plenty of interregional commerce. It was also renowned for its Pokémon gym, which specialized in electric types. The gym leader was a former military lieutenant by the name of Surge, who had fought alongside his Pokémon in the Plasma War on the Unovan side; Ash was eager to see the techniques of how a warrior would command Pokémon in battle, finding something oddly magnetic about the idea.</p>

<p>"Whatcha think, Pikachu? Should we head straight to the gym, or do we get a bite to eat first?"</p>

<p>"<i>Piiika-chuuu</i>," replied Pikachu, its plumed tail whisking happily as it leapt onto Ash's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hey Red! Don't tell me you only just got to Vermillion?"</p>

<p>Ash turned upon hearing the familiar sound of his rival's voice, and even Pikachu lifted its ears. "Blue! How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Just on my way out," answered Gary.</p>

<p>Ash blinked with surprise. "You mean you already challenged the gym?"</p>

<p>"Yep," Gary said, proudly showing off the badge. The pin was a glittering orange gemstone cut into a sunburst shape, the distinctive emblem of Vermillion's Pokémon gym. "I'm off to the next town now. What took you so long to get here, Red?"</p>

<p>"I spent some time training with Pikachu in the tall grass around Cerulean. You know the Saffron gates were blocked," Ash couldn't help but remark with resentment.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but better not to mess with that." Nothing further was said about Team Rocket, and Gary changed the topic eagerly. "I've already caught like 40 kinds of Pokémon already. How many have you caught so far?"</p>

<p>"Well...to tell you the truth I've been focusing on training," Ash admitted. "I was actually considering doing the whole League challenge with just Pikachu."</p>

<p>"Red, you can't be serious! A solo run with a <i>Pikachu</i>?"</p>

<p>Ash looked defensive. "Lots of trainers do their League challenge with just one Pokémon. Over in Unova, one of their champions even won against the Elite Four with a lone Vaporeon."</p>

<p>"A Vaporeon is an evolved Pokémon. Unevolved Pokémon have abysmal stats and aren't good when you're in it competitive. I thought your goal was to actually win?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to apply for a League job."</p>

<p>"They only take the best you know." Spite was written across Gary's face. "When are you getting a thunder stone to evolve your Pikachu into a Raichu, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Pikachu says he likes being a Pikachu."</p>

<p>"This is why I'm always a step ahead of you."</p>

<p>Pikachu was sparking angrily; Ash stroked his pet in a soothing way and tried not to become too aggravated himself by his rival's inflexible opinions.</p>

<p>"You know what you do when you have a weak Pokémon?" said Gary.</p>

<p>"Spend more time training it," Ash replied.</p>

<p>"Wrong. You trade it for something better."</p>

<p>Ash briefly found himself imagining, with more pleasure than he would have liked, letting Pikachu have at it and shock Gary. He held himself back from the temptation.</p>

<p>"See this Red?" added Gary, showing him a ticket with the name of some ocean liner, "Right now I've got a ticket for the ship leaving harbor, which will be making port at various regions. I heard there are different kinds of Pokémon worldwide and I'm going to spend a week catching some rare ones before returning to finish off my League challenge. With the fast progress I'm making, I can afford to take the scenic route. Smell ya later," he quipped.</p>

<p>He left for the pier, his stride as arrogant as his attitude. Pikachu gave a chatter that brought a small smile to Ash's face.</p>

<p>"Come on Pikachu...Blue might be a jerk sometimes but that's kind of crude language," chided Ash.</p>

<p>"<i>Chu</i>," the little animal replied scornfully.</p>

<p>The Vermillion gym was located on the waterfront overlooking the ships as they came and went. Ash signed in at the front desk and didn't have to wait long before he was met by the gym leader and ushered to the gym's battlefield.</p>

<p>The leaderboard off to the side displayed the two Pokémon on the battlefield, Pikachu and Raichu, together with full green lines indicating their overall strength. Special detectors in the gym floor could measure their health that way, providing an accurate manner of preventing serious injury; when the bar ran from green to yellow to a sliver of red, and finally empty, it indicated who was winning and losing the match.</p>

<p>Unlike the battles in Pewter and Cerulean, which had been won by luck and type advantage respectively, this was the first true challenge Ash encountered, and he realized he may have been a bit too hasty in presuming his own skill. Surge's Raichu was nimble for its size, and powerful whenever it struck. Pikachu seemed flustered and Ash found himself second-guessing his choice of moves.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" Ash cried.</p>

<p>"Flash," ordered Surge.</p>

<p>There was a brilliant gleam of light, and Pikachu leapt back, momentarily blinded before it could fire off its attack. It was enough for Raichu to spring, tackling Pikachu forcibly to the ground. The bar measuring Pikachu's strength shot to empty, and the leaderboard displayed Raichu as the winner.</p>

<p>"Very good, Raichu," said Surge, and Raichu stood upright, allowing Pikachu to shake itself off and limp free.</p>

<p>Ash scooped his pet up into his arms with worry. "Hey Pikachu, you okay?" he asked.</p>

<p>Pikachu, looking exhausted but not very injured, gave a low growl. "<i>Pika-chuuu</i>..."</p>

<p>"We'll head to the Pokémon Center. You were awesome," he said, petting the little animal.</p>

<p>From the Vermillion gym, Ash went straight to the Pokémon Center. He went up to the reception desk, placing Pikachu in its Poké Ball only long enough for the nurse to restore it to full health. As the restoring machine did its function and then beeped, signifying the Pokémon inside had been fully healed, Ash mulled over how the gym battle had gone and tried to figure out how he was ever going to get strong enough to beat Surge. It was an added insult somehow that it had been a <i>Raichu</i> to defeat them, as if it somehow ascribed legitimacy to Gary saying he should force Pikachu to evolve.</p>

<p>The Poké Ball was twitching as he got it back from the nurse. He immediately sent out Pikachu, which emerged with an affronted shake of its fur.</p>

<p>"I know you hate going in your Poké Ball, but that wasn't so bad was it?" said Ash in an assuring way.</p>

<p>Pikachu gave a sound somewhere between a chirp and a <i>ffftt</i>. Sometimes Ash wondered why Pikachu was so opposed to being carried about in its Poké Ball. Any time they'd had to go somewhere that required all Pokémon to be in their carriers – which thankfully, considering the laxity of society towards pets, was few and far between – he remembered how he had to chase Pikachu around to try and get it into its Poké Ball, an ordeal unto itself. Eventually Ash had explained to Pikachu that it was at least necessary for healing up quickly at Pokémon Centers, but it still detested it. Pikachu said it didn't like the feeling of being trapped. Ash thought it was claustrophobic.</p>

<p>Pikachu hopped onto his shoulder as Ash wandered over to look at the map posted on the side of the Pokémon Center lobby.</p>

<p>"I guess we could train some more along route 6. Meanwhile Gary's going to outpace us even further. Too bad we can't get into Saffron – those damned Rockets! – and the journey's kind of on hold unless we can beat the gym here in Vermillion..."</p>

<p>As he regarded the other cities on the map, he suddenly realized the folly of his supposition.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. What am I saying? There's nothing that says I have to challenge them in order! And why am I going to let those Team Rocket thugs dictate whether or not I can go to Saffron City?" <i>Besides, I already skipped the Viridian gym and will have to go back to it at some point...</i> he thought, glancing at his Pokémon.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Pikachu? Do we postpone the rematch and see if we can get into Saffron from route 8?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pika</i>!" squeaked Pikachu, who was evidently happy to do whatever Ash saw fit.</p>

<p>"Then that's what we'll do," Ash decided. "Onward to Lavender Town!"</p><hr />

<p>Globe-trotting was usually the realm of experienced trainers, not fledgling ones on their first journey to collect gym badges. To Gary's mind, however, he was certain to win his League challenge, and he had enough money to afford the excursion anyway.</p>

<p>The ship was going to make stops in the regions of Hoenn, Orre, and Unova, before circling round to return to Sinnoh, Johto, and Kanto. It wasn't nearly enough time in each to be a proper sampling of all they had to offer, but it was enough for a small jaunt of nearby tourist destinations, or to spend a day or so hunting region-specific species.</p>

<p>Of all these the least interesting to Gary was initially Orre, if only because the region lacked wild Pokémon. That said, it had other things to draw a trainer's eye; the minute he heard about the so called battling destination of Orre, Realgam Tower, it was no longer Gary's least appealing stop and instead his most awaited one. He'd spend his stay in Orre there enjoying the battles and the nightlife.</p>

<p>He heard that was the week of its grand opening, so Gary decided to visit.</p>

<p>Gary walked up to the receptionist at the check-in for the colosseum, his head held as high as if he had already won the competition. "Excuse me, I'd like to take part in the colosseum battle."</p>

<p>"Sorry, you just missed it. There won't be another one till tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night?" He wouldn't be in Orre tomorrow night.</p>

<p>Everyone had heard of the grandeur of Orrean colosseums. Till the great stadiums in Galar had been built, Orre's had been the most magnificent in the world. The stadium here at Realgam was unique – it was a modern Orrean colosseum, designed by the financier who had built the Galarian ones. Gary had wanted very much to see it in person, from the arena, where he could show off his Pokémon. Granted he would have probably been vastly outlevelled, something he hadn't really thought of when he asked, but that was not the point.</p>

<p>With the colosseum closed, he decided to go see the casino located at the ground floor of Realgam Tower. That was open, to his delight.</p>

<p>As he walked in and took a quick glance around, he saw a familiar looking face. It was one he had seen posted around Phenac City in political advertisements: that of the mayor, Evice Cade. He was standing at the roulette table. Gary wandered over and said, "Glad to see a mayor taking interest in the businesses of his town."</p>

<p>"Thank you...and who might you be?"</p>

<p>"Gary. Gary Oak...I'm a trainer and curiosity brought me in here.</p>

<p>"Well Gary," replied Cade, "you saw, now leave."</p>

<p>Gary ignored the remark and kept talking. "Maybe if the stadium were open several more hours into the night more people would come."</p>

<p>"What would really attract people here would be getting to see a very rare Pokémon in a fight. Unfortunately I have no way to get a Legendary Pokémon...but I know where to find them," Cade added.</p>

<p>"You do?" he questioned with surprise; then, dubiously, "...why tell me?"</p>

<p>"You're a professional trainer, aren't you?"</p>

<p>The fact it had been so evident made Gary haughty. "Yeah, I am."</p>

<p>"Then maybe you could help me catch them." Cade spoke smoothly. "I have on good account that three Pokémon, once thought to be creatures of myth, currently run wild in the Johto region. Their names are Suicune, Raikou, and Entei."</p>

<p>Gary flipped out his Pokédex, bringing up the entries for each:</p>

<p>
  <i>Suicune<br />
Type: Water<br />
This divine Pokémon was said to be the reincarnation of north winds. Legend states it can instantly purify filthy, murky water.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Raikou<br />
Type: Electric<br />
Its cry was said to sound like crashing thunder. Legend states that it carries rain clouds on its back, letting it fire thunderbolts at will.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Entei<br />
Type: Fire<br />
Its flames were said to be hotter than a volcano's magma. Legend states when it roars, a volcano erupts somewhere around the globe.</i>
</p>

<p>"Are you sure they were <i>these</i> Pokémon and not some others?" inquired Gary dubiously. "This reads like they haven't been seen in centuries. They don't even have a photograph on here, only an artist's rendering."</p>

<p>Cade was firm. "In the past few days they've been roaming around the Johto region and have already been spotted by a few people."</p>

<p>"The ship will be making a stop in Johto right before it returns to Kanto," Gary said contemplatively. "I could stay there and return to Kanto myself via a bird Pokémon...the two regions border each other, after all. But what makes you so sure I can find the Legendary Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"These creatures aren't hard to miss," assured Cade, "and I would rather take the initiative to catch them before some other ambitious trainer gets the notion to do so."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go yourself?"</p>

<p>"My mayoral duties tend to keep me close to the Orre region. I'm willing to pay handsomely for the three Legendary Pokémon to be delivered to me."</p>

<p>"In all honesty," replied Gary, "what I'd really want for my trouble isn't even cash. I want a team of Pokémon strong enough to help me win against Kanto's Elite Four. I can't imagine any that would be more powerful than a Legendary Pokémon though."</p>

<p>"I'll find something worthwhile to trade you for them in that case," said Cade, to which Gary gave a shrug and a nod.</p>

<p>"If you're sure you can find something stronger...yeah, sure, I'll help you."</p>

<p>So when Gary left the Realgam Tower casino, it was with a skip in his step and grandiose schemes already forming as to how to catch the rare creatures.</p>

<p>Cade meanwhile spent the rest of the night gambling, and retired late in an upbeat mood despite having lost more than won. He had a wager still playing out: that if Gary successfully brought back the Pokémon, it would create an opportunity. The thought of how much more lucrative the new colosseum would prove was part of it, yet what Cade secretly wanted went far beyond finance.</p>

<p>Three legends, three families. And if Cade possessed them all, so long as there was nothing comparably stronger out there – well, then, maybe he could take his vacation to Johto early.</p>

<p>Mahogany Town, thought Archer with displeasure, was even smaller than Azalea.</p>

<p>Maybe that was not being fair to Mahogany, he reconsidered less dismissively, at least the people here were business-minded. Tourism had been the town's main income, for the adjacent Lake of Rage had once been a breeding spot for wild Gyarados, and attracted interested parties galore: fishermen, Pokémon trainers, and the curious, all of whom would stay in local lodging and eat at local restaurants and buy local chocolate called 'Rage-candybars'. Overhunting eventually decimated the regional Gyarados population, and consequently visitors to Mahogany, yet the townsfolk still straggled along with their small businesses in the frail hopes of a revival. Nowadays all there was in that lake were Magikarp and they were usually snapped up before they could ever evolve.</p>

<p>Their base of operations in town was a small shop nestled between shade trees and along Main Street. The former proprietor had owed Team Rocket a debt for some favor and had quite intelligently, without any need for persuasion, bartered ownership of his store as repayment.</p>

<p>The business sold foodstuffs and was the town's only grocery store. This meant it turned a profit, to the pleasant surprise of Rocket Enterprises. The most peculiar thing about the store was the cellar, which from what the former shopkeeper told them had once been a ninja hideout. Archer did not know if he believed the story about ninjas, however the cellar was secluded and cozy and could easily be repurposed into a hideout for Team Rocket.</p>

<p>Two Persian statues of white marble stood at the foyer, the forehead jewel hiding a miniature security camera that alerted them to any intruders. The cameras were a formality, like having a smoke detector; except for a police raid perhaps – and they had connections to warn them of that occurrence – the idea of intruders upon a Team Rocket fortress was ludicrous. <em>No one was that stupid,</em> thought Archer with a contented smirk.</p>

<p>Archer met Dr. Ethan Colress at the grocery store's upper level and descended to the cellar with him, past the foyer, to a laboratory area.</p>

<p>Dr. Colress was slim, with amber eyes framed by rectangular eyeglasses, and neat blond hair bearing a single streak of blue. He had worked for Team Plasma during the infamous Plasma War in the Unova region, and nowadays was officially a government scientist, but he moonlighted for Team Rocket to further, as he put it, "the valuable interests of Science." He and Giovanni got along well; Giovanni funded his research but allowed him to conduct experiments as he saw fit, so long as he gave him updates on the progress, which was much the same arrangement Colress had with his previous benefactor during wartime.</p>

<p>The scientist headed the genetic project Giovanni had been financing. The crux of their research was the effects of radio waves on the genome, to find a way to alter it to increase power and breed the world's strongest Pokémon. They drew on previous research the scientist had done, and had studied the effects of Galarian dyna-max radiation from special minerals. Discoveries in the Hoenn region had drawn their attention most recently to extinct species.</p>

<p>"Lately we'd been cross-breeding Rotom with Psyduck and prehistoric Pokémon cloned from fossils," explained Colress.</p>

<p>"And how's that going?" asked Archer, who didn't give a damn.</p>

<p>"Experiments have resulted in these."</p>

<p>'These' turned out to be flightless bird Pokémon, with blocky plumage and the blank stares of Psyduck. Colress had a flock of them, and they all evidently had decided they liked to stare at Archer – something Archer found unnerving.</p>

<p>"What the hell <em>are</em> they?"</p>

<p>"We call them Porygons."</p>

<p>"Are they even breathing?"</p>

<p>"They only have to breathe once every half-hour. They're hardy but, alas, not nearly as powerful as we'd hoped. Giovanni is considering selling some of them to the Space Center for use in their intergalactic exploration program, or give them out as prizes in the casinos."</p>

<p><em>Maybe as a novelty, but they look kind of useless.</em> Archer let temptation get the better of him and decided to poke one of the Porygon. He jumped back suddenly when it responded with a static shock and a displeased chirp.</p>

<p>"Now Joe, one musn't immediately attack," Colress scolded the bird.</p>

<p>Archer rubbed his sore hand sourly. "What was it you needed?"</p>

<p>"We've isolated a wavelength that affects the gene responsible for inducing evolution in most Pokémon. We plan to try broadcasting it and see what happens."</p>

<p>"Do it."</p>

<p>"We are uncertain what will happen, so just in case we get the townspeople irate, having a large number of Team Rocket guards here helps."</p>

<p>"So you'd basically like us to stand by in case the villagers show up with pitchforks and torches."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Off-topic you'd better tell your people not to pester the Porygon. They're irritable before they've had their coffee."</p>

<p>"You're feeding these birds coffee?"</p>

<p>"We're seeing how the caffeine affects them. They do seem to love the taste of coffee though."</p>

<p>"So I take it you named them after coffee?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. Joe is short for Joseph, after the brilliant physicist who discovered..."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have asked. Look, we'll get our guards stationed as soon as humanly possible so you can get back to your work."</p>

<p>They shook hands and Archer walked back upstairs leaving the scientist to his studies.</p><hr />

<p>At least their job here was straightforward, even seemingly easy. What Archer had not accounted for was how idiotic the minions could get when faced with monotony.</p>

<p>Case in point one mid-morning when one such subordinate made an exceptional observation.</p>

<p>"Do you realize we're living off of trees shitting?"</p>

<p>Archer turned to them with a double-take. "What?"</p>

<p>"No really. Think about it. Plants absorb carbon dioxide, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And then they release oxgyen, which we breathe in, right?"</p>

<p>"<em>Yes</em>..."</p>

<p>"We're living off of trees shitting."</p>

<p>Archer decided right then and there he was fed up with listening to this morning's philosophical conversation and decided to slink off. Even listening to Kris try to convince him to let her into Team Rocket was better; at least she could hold logical conversations, even if she was hell-bent on joining the gang.</p>

<p><em>But who didn’t have an ulterior motive?</em> figured Archer.</p>

<p>He left the store and wandered out to route 42, a tranquil path crisscrossed by rivers and creeks beneath the imposing shadow of Mount Mortar. This route kept a nice balance between untamed and pruned, with a wide trail beside grassy fields dotted by bushes, and lush trees beyond that grew gradually closer together till they stretched naturally off into the distance, while the singing of Taillow and Pidgey lent a peaceful soundtrack. The morning sun warmed the climate, and outlined the weaving rivers with light.</p>

<p>If one continued down the path, it would eventually lead to Ecruteak, but Archer had no intention to go that far. He was about to turn back when he heard a rustle in the bracken.</p>

<p>There was an apple orchard beyond the hedgerows and it attracted all varieties of wild Pokémon. Curious at how large this had sounded, he pushed through the bushes and discovered a small sunlit clearing.</p>

<p>Archer found Kris sitting under the trees, her pet Eevee curled up on her lap, and a cluster of apples she had picked beside her.</p>

<p>There was also the Suicune. She was feeding said Suicune the apples.</p>

<p>Kris, sensing someone, glanced up. "Oh hi Archer."</p>

<p>"What do you have here?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Apples. Want some?"</p>

<p>He was still staring incredulously at the Legendary Pokémon hanging out like if it had been invited to a picnic. Kris offered a matter-of-fact explanation:</p>

<p>"Suicune likes me."</p>

<p>"Or it likes apples," observed Archer.</p>

<p>"That could be part of it," she admitted.</p>

<p>Suicune gave a happy little cry and, seizing another apple, dashed past Archer. "You haven't caught it with a Poké Ball then?"</p>

<p>"No I've been letting Suicune do its own thing. Do you think I should?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please do," said Archer flatly, "the sooner the better."</p>

<p>Kris collected the remaining apples in her bag and stood up. "I'm visiting Mahogany Town to challenge the gym. Do you know where it is?"</p>

<p>"Straight across from the Pokémon Center. You can't miss it."</p>

<p>"Thanks! Come on, Eevee," she remarked to her Pokémon, which scampered happily after her.</p>

<p>"Take Aspear berries in case of frostbite," Archer shouted after her, "they specialize in ice types."</p><hr />

<p>Pryce was the gym leader of Mahogany and a friend of the Delavitas. He did not care that Team Rocket would be in town or what they would be up to and if anything they had his blessing. He had been on good terms with the family for many years and always repaid his debts. Most recently it helped that his granddaughter Lorelei had been promoted to be a member of the Elite Four, upon Giovanni's recommendation. Payments were in order, but gratitude was priceless.</p>

<p>So Archer did not expect him that afternoon, hemming and hawing as if he was uncertain about how his words should be received, and it was only with some prompting that the gym leader finally spoke his mind.</p>

<p>"You remember how there were only Magikarp in the Lake of Rage?" asked Pryce.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well lately they started evolving."</p>

<p>"Colress will be happy to hear that."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure if you're aware, Gyarados have a hierarchy. Because they all evolved at once they all want to claim the lake territory and become alpha."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"They started fighting each other. So now we've got a lake full of Gyarados shooting Hyper Beams at each other. They seem to get particularly agitated when they hear that radio tune you guys are broadcasting."</p>

<p>"And you're here to plead for us to stop airing it."</p>

<p>"Plead? I'm here to thank you on behalf of all Mahogany. We've got tourists by the busload coming in to see the Gyarados rampage. The town is raking in more money than ever before. Any way you can crank up the modulation on that radio transmitter of yours and get 'em extra angry?"</p>

<p>Archer decided to go to the Lake of Rage and see what all the fuss was about. He'd heard tell of the wild Gyarados fighting by a fair number of people now but he hadn't witnessed the scene for himself, having had no interest till now. He saw little difference between wild Pokémon battles and League sporting ones, save for the absence of strength gauges and statistic measures that made it easier to follow the tide of the fight. There was not even the drama of expectation; wild Pokémon did not fight to the death over territory, just as League matches were never carried to the point of serious injury.</p>

<p>The adjoining route had two pathways to the lake. One was wild with tall grass and foliage, and was usually only traversed by trainers hunting for Pokémon. The other was a clear, wide trail of trimmed grass, which was a straight walk to the lakeshore, and which was accessed through a gatehouse that Team Rocket had shrewdly decided to overtake as a toll-booth. Team Rocket members were of course exempt from the toll, so Archer opted for the clear path; meeting up with territorial wild Pokémon while walking through the tall grass was a waste of valuable time.</p>

<p>He walked in to find Kris chatting with the Team Rocket guard. Her Eevee was perched on the guard's desk, and gave an alerting cry when it saw Archer approach.</p>

<p>"...so no matter who wins, it's a win-win. Hi Archer," she greeted.</p>

<p>Archer tipped his head but kept walking. "<em>Buongiorno</em>, Kris."</p>

<p>He had gone but a few pace before a second thought made him spin on his heel. "What the hell are you doing?"</p>

<p>"We got a bet going," explained Kris seriously.</p>

<p>The guard corroborated, "We're gonna ask the first pedestrian who walks through here a question, and based on their answer one of us wins."</p>

<p>"Wins what?"</p>

<p>"If she wins she doesn't have to pay the toll, and she takes my post here for the rest of the day."</p>

<p>"So I can show off how useful I can be to Team Rocket," explained Kris.</p>

<p>"...and if you win?" Archer glanced skeptically back to the guard.</p>

<p>"If I win she has to pay the toll, and she takes my post here for the week."</p>

<p>"Stop trying to shirk your duties, Wyatt," snapped Archer.</p>

<p>"Hold on," exclaimed Kris, "you're the first pedestrian! That means you get to answer our question."</p>

<p>Archer crossed his arms expectantly and stared at her, and Kris asked:</p>

<p>"Is an Eevee part of the cat family, or the dog family?"</p>

<p>She held out the little Pokémon, which squeaked.</p>

<p>Archer stared first at the Eevee, then at the two gamblers, and finally scowled, "What kind of stupidity is this? Everyone can see it's got the ears of a rabbit. You." He pointed at Kris and motioned. "Come with me."</p>

<p>"But what about the toll?" insisted the guard.</p>

<p>"Forget the damn toll. She's an honorary member of Team Rocket anyway, considering how we can't shake her off," replied a resigned Archer.</p>

<p>This made Kris' eyes light up enormously and as she hurried after Archer, she asked cheerily, "Are you going to see the Gyarados rampage too?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm going to see all the idiot tourists to decide how to capitalize on them."</p>

<p>When they got to the lakeshore Archer was unsurprised to find the small crowd milling at the water's edge, most gazing out to the center of the lake, a few picnicking on the grass, and several taking photographs. What he didn't expect was how far away the Gyarados were. Salesmen were hawking binoculars so people could get a better look at the powerful Pokémon fighting in the distance.</p>

<p>Archer shook his head incredulously. <em>I was right, of course. Watching League matches on television is better. At least they give close-ups.</em></p>

<p>Kris was holding the Eevee over her head. "Can you see them, Eevee?"</p>

<p>The Eevee squeaked.</p>

<p>"All right Kris," decided Archer, "I've got another test for you if you want to join Team Rocket. Considering the results of the first one in Ecruteak weren't certain."</p>

<p>"I found three Legendary Pokémon," she pointed out.</p>

<p>"You also fell in a hole."</p>

<p>"Okay," she conceded. "What's the challenge?"</p>

<p>"Catch a Gyarados and bring it to the town grocery store. The store is owned by Rocket Enterprises so we'll be there. Here are some Poké Balls...they're all registered to me, so the Pokémon you catch with them belongs to us. <em>Capice</em>?"</p>

<p><em>That oughta keep her busy for a while,</em> he figured, seeing her sprint away with the Eevee at her heels.</p><hr />

<p>It was approaching dinnertime when Kris showed up at the grocery store.</p>

<p>"I caught a Gyarados," she announced happily, holding out the Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"Oh, er, thanks." Archer took the Poké Ball half-heartedly. <em>Damn, I thought that would have kept her away longer.</em></p>

<p>"To tell you the truth it looks kind of ill," she admitted, as if having read his mind. "Maybe that's why it was so easy to catch."</p>

<p>"Ill in what way?"</p>

<p>"It's red."</p>

<p>"It's <em>red</em>?" Archer's eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>One of the cadets chimed in obliviously, "Maybe it's got high blood pressure?"</p>

<p>Archer turned to him with incredulous ire. "You idiot, don't you realize that a red Gyarados is worth a <em>fortune</em>? What does Giovanni pay you for?"</p>

<p>"So can I join Team Rocket?" Kris prompted.</p>

<p>"I'll think about it."</p>

<p>"No fair! I brought you a Gyarados."</p>

<p>"In Team Rocket, we're only <em>fair</em> when it's profitable," answered Archer. "First lesson for you. However, you're showing promise."</p>

<p>He had a small good-natured smile on his face nonetheless, and Kris, far from being dissuaded, returned a similarly sly smile as she left the grocery store. Glancing over to the windows, Archer noticed how both their images reflected on the glass, and he blinked with perplexity.</p>

<p>Field work was something James, Jessie, and Meowth had not done in a while, being mostly Giovanni's personal guard and top enforcers. So when the trio were sent by Giovanni to briefly take over management of Team Rocket's smuggling operations, they saw it as a surprising but not unwelcome change of pace.</p>

<p>Lavender Town was small and peaceful, a forested hamlet in a mountain cove, and would have been considered an ideal dwelling place were it not for the tremendous reverence everybody held towards it as a harbour of the spiritual. Some people did not wish to live there for fear of the ghosts said to haunt it.</p>

<p>Team Rocket did not mind ghosts – which in any case were mostly ghost type Pokémon, live creatures able to take the form of energy at will. They minded their business, which was more than could often be said for beings of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth had a group of about twenty or so lower rank agents under their supervision to aid with transporting stolen Pokémon. A semi-abandoned warehouse on the town outskirts served as a relay point for Team Rocket's activities, which went uneventfully till one of these subordinates walked in with a small cage.</p>

<p>He was fairly young, with green hair and eyes of a matching shade; they knew him as Krieger, a recruit who had been with the syndicate for roughly a year. Relentlessly tagging after him was a puppy Pokémon called a Poochyena, which he always seemed to ignore.</p>

<p>"That doesn't look like one of the animals we've been moving," Jessie observed the cage with interest.</p>

<p>"I trapped it out on route 10," explained Krieger haughtily.</p>

<p>The trio crowded around the cage dubiously. Meanwhile the young Pokémon inside huddled as far from them as it could, looking both frightened and dismal. It was a small brown creature with a horny covering that masked its face.</p>

<p>James voiced their unanimous thought. "This Cubone barely looks weaned."</p>

<p>"There was a Marowak too," said Krieger.</p>

<p>"A Marowak?" All three immediately lifted their heads with interest. These were the evolved form of Cubone and scarce.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it might've been the parent of this Cubone."</p>

<p>"Marowak fetch a high price," noted Jessie.</p>

<p>"And it's a ground type," James added, "I bet the boss would be thrilled to get one for his gym."</p>

<p>"<i>Mrreow</i>! Where's the Pokémon?" yowled Meowth.</p>

<p>Krieger gave a derisive laugh and said, "The damn thing wouldn't let me take its cub so I left it for dead. It's probably carrion for the Fearow now!"</p>

<p>He faltered when Jessie's eyes suddenly flashed with infuriated blue fire, and he could not step back before she struck out with the whip, lashing across his face and making him gasp.</p>

<p>"You <i>idiot</i>!" she nearly hissed, "Killing rare Pokémon, for no reason, when you could have caught it instead! What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Even Meowth let out an angered growl, and James, though similarly displeased, tried to mollify the situation. "Now Jessie, let's not get carried away yet. If he left it for dead, then it might still be alive, right?"</p>

<p>"Go back and get that Pokémon, and you'd better <i>hope</i> it's alive!" snapped Jessie.</p>

<p>Meowth punctuated Jessie's words with a hiss, and the visibly shaken minion dipped his head and left.</p><hr />

<p>They did not think much of the incident after that, though James kept eyeing the Cubone's cage and complaining the infant creature would die without its parent, with Jessie responding they would bottle-feed it if it came to that – no thanks to their stupid minion, making more work for them.</p>

<p>Meowth meanwhile was pensive about the whole matter. He seemed to be analysing something, but did not care to discuss it with anyone, and lingered around their other subordinates watchfully.</p>

<p>James and Jessie let their own Pokémon out for feeding time. Jessie's violet cobra Arbok and James' buoyantly spherical Weezing were both poison types, raised to a moderately high level; they were milling about their food when Krieger and his Poochyena returned. Jessie stepped away to speak to him and came back shortly.</p>

<p>"The Marowak's gone," she announced flatly.</p>

<p>"It died?" James asked with disappointment.</p>

<p>No," said Jessie with frustration, "it's gone. Some Pokémon trainer passing by apparently picked it up."</p>

<p>"We're having a stroke of bad luck lately, aren't we," James sighed.</p>

<p>Meowth now wandered over, his tail lashing. "There's a fight brewing. You guys should take a look."</p>

<p>Before either of them could respond, there was a commotion in the adjoining room. They hurried over to find their subordinates all standing around in a wide ring, watching two other minions in a fist fight.</p>

<p>One, they realized, was Krieger. He had evidently placed Poochyena in its Poké Ball, perhaps refusing to accept a loss in an earlier Pokémon battle over some dispute and feeling he could beat his opponent personally. Jessie clapped her hands twice. "Arbok, break them up!"</p>

<p>At her signal, the large snake struck out and separated the two men, baring its long fangs menacingly as if it planned to bite the first one who moved. They backed away fearfully.</p>

<p>"All right," James demanded, "what was that about?"</p>

<p>"He's talking treason," said the first.</p>

<p>"You liar," Krieger countered.</p>

<p>One of the spectators jumped in, "I heard what he said... he said someone else might be a better leader than Giovanni. He also said he wasn't the only person in Team Rocket who thought that way and they were going to do something about it."</p>

<p>Jessie turned back evenly to Krieger. "Well, Krieger – is that true?"</p>

<p>He stumbled over his words, unable to articulate any coherent excuse. He was trapped, and in sudden panic decided to make a break for it by whipping out a revolver he had hidden.</p>

<p>Arbok and Weezing tensed to attack but James lifted a hand, and they held back.</p>

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth observed Krieger coldly. The rest of their minions all lingered about like kittens eager to watch how full-grown wildcats dispatched prey, and seemed perplexed at their present restraint.</p>

<p>This was a surprise to Krieger too, but he was not about to question it. Perhaps in hindsight he should have.</p>

<p>"Do you really think you'll get away from Team Rocket?" Jessie posed mildly.</p>

<p>"You think you're all that?" Krieger gloated. "I'm forcing you to accept credit."</p>

<p>James responded with calculated tranquillity. "We're accepting your credit because we intend to collect <i>with interest</i>."</p>

<p>Meowth punctuated this with a hiss.</p>

<p>Without stopping to consider the implication of those words, Krieger raced out the door.</p><hr />

<p>Shadows of looming nightfall stretched mournfully across the lonely streets of Lavender, like the foreboding of coming peril. Of course peril was a matter of perspective; it depended on who wielded it.</p>

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth, in full uniform, had tracked Krieger all the way to the seedier side of town. Whereas the streets at this hour were quiet as death, the tavern was alive with the warmth of boisterous people and vibrant music.</p>

<p>No sooner did they step into the establishment that they noticed a familiar face rise from a table and dart inconspicuously to the back of the tavern, disappearing through a panelled wood door.</p>

<p>"He's escaping out the back," muttered James.</p>

<p>Meowth growled, yet with excitement rather than anger. "I've prowled around these parts before. I haven't found any opening in the back. The prey just trapped itself."</p>

<p>"We've got him just where we want him," Jessie replied, mischief in her eyes as she strode dramatically up to the bartender, faced the room and slammed her hand on the counter.</p>

<p>"Drinks on us throughout the night!" Jessie announced, to a hearty shout of delight from all there.</p>

<p>James had a smile. "I'm sorry Jessie, why are we doing this again?"</p>

<p>"Because the drunks will be too happy to care what happens in the back room," she replied wryly.</p>

<p>"This is why I like you guys," purred Meowth, "you think like cats."</p>

<p>With a blatant skip in her step Jessie went ahead, followed by Meowth prancing with tail held high. James lingered near the counter and handed the bartender several bills of rolled cash.</p>

<p>"This," explained James, "is for silence – and for the band to play all night as loud as they want. We'll make sure your tavern gets reimbursed for the rest."</p>

<p>"Not a problem," said the bartender, though he stammered a little nervously as he took the bills, "We got no problem with Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"To your health," James toasted slyly and, procuring a rose from the vase adjacent to the counter, stepped quickly after his companions.</p>

<p>The back of the tavern was a suitably abandoned place. A short flight of steps descended to a windowless storage cellar full of crates holding beers and wines, a wood table atop which was some kind of radio system, and a couple of chairs, but nothing more; perfectly isolated for the Team Rocket trio to hold their unexpected prisoner.</p>

<p><i>And he had gone there himself, the fool,</i> thought James.</p>

<p>They found Krieger at the table, talking through the radio – or trying to. He adjusted the knobs on the antiquated device, trying to get a signal. "Hello...? This is number 27. You hear me?"</p>

<p>Beside him on the floor, Poochyena started yapping upon seeing the couple posed at the top of the steps. Meowth bounded soundlessly onto one of the crates and slipped up to the rafters.</p>

<p>"Shut up you mutt," growled Krieger, without caring to look over, "I can't hear!"</p>

<p>Poochyena only yapped louder.</p>

<p>"<i>Buonasera</i>," greeted James succinctly.</p>

<p>It made Krieger turn around in shock.</p>

<p>From the rafters, there came a caterwaul and a rush of cream fur; Meowth landed on Krieger's head, as if he were ambushing a Raticate, and sank his claws in.</p>

<p>A yelp arose, not from Poochyena but from Krieger, who nearly toppled out of the chair and, hurling the cat off him, tried to get to his feet only to be tripped by the pull of Jessie's whip. He crashed onto his back, and as James and Jessie towered over him, Poochyena was yapping frantically in the back with Meowth hissing.</p>

<p>"What's with this dog?" chided Meowth. "We're not gonna hurt <i>you</i>. When's the last time he fed you anyway? You look scrawny. Hey guys..." he turned to his friends, "we got some food for the dog?"</p>

<p>Poochyena stopped yapping in sudden astonishment and began wagging its tail.</p>

<p>"Traitor," Krieger seethed at the dog.</p>

<p>"Hypocrite," retorted Jessie, pulling his attention back to them.</p>

<p>"The boss doesn't take kindly to betrayal," added James, his green eyes as sharp as thorns. He held the rose in a showy fashion adding, "It's the worst of crimes. ...We've come to collect our interest."</p><hr />

<p>Using a videophone, Jessie, James, and Meowth contacted Giovanni. When the trio told him what had transpired with Krieger and how they now held him prisoner, Giovanni listened without reaction, and only when they finished the whole story did he comment:</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"We wanted to know if you had special orders," said James.</p>

<p>"You know what to do," replied Giovanni, retrieving a long-stemmed rose from somewhere off-screen and turning back to the trio. "Find out how many other traitors there are within our ranks. Find out who their leader is." As he spoke, he picked the leaves, pointedly, from the rose stem one by one. His eyes never left the screen, and his voice remained pleasant.</p>

<p>"Afterwards... <i>mandagli i miei saluti</i>."</p>

<p>And with that he hung up.</p>

<p>The two elite agents and the cat all looked at each other, bearing nothing more than nonchalance.</p>

<p>"What time is it, James?" asked Jessie.</p>

<p>James glanced at the time on his transceiver. "Almost midnight."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed with boredom. "Let's see how long this takes."</p><hr />

<p>If it had been an hour, it was a day; if it had been a day, it was a week.</p>

<p>Time took on agonising qualities. Maybe they would've secretly enjoyed beating him up, if only for how much of a disrespectful braggart he was, were it not for the fact they all wanted to be elsewhere. That was the problem with Giovanni ordering them to get information from someone. When the person wasn't reasonable it dragged on...and on... Though in all fairness it probably dragged on more for the victim, but that was kind of the point.</p>

<p>Meowth had led the Poochyena up from the cellar to the bartender, who had been instructed to feed the hungry creature. The bartender, of course, complied immediately. The cat had then returned.</p>

<p>"They still out there drinking away the night?" asked James as the cat hopped onto the table.</p>

<p>"Are you kidding? They'll be out there till dawn," purred Meowth. "A few of them have already burst into song."</p>

<p>"Good," said James.</p>

<p>Jessie meanwhile was standing directly in front of Krieger. They had tied him with rope to one of the chairs. "Is this what you used to shoot the Marowak?" she asked, examining the revolver she had taken from him.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Team Rocket only rarely issues handguns to our agents, and never to low-rank rookies," she continued. "The same person who gave you this, is the one you were trying to contact with the radio. Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>"Fuck you," retorted Krieger, finally opening his mouth only to say the wrong thing. James and Jessie exchanged a dubious glance.</p>

<p>"Cocky, isn't he?" Jessie placed the revolver aside on the table. "Considering it's not like anyone will be able to find him here."</p>

<p>"Now Jessie," James pacified, "Maybe we should give him one more chance."</p>

<p>"I think we're wasting our time," scowled Jessie.</p>

<p>"Well, probably," conceded James, "but...what's it going to hurt us?"</p>

<p>Jessie seemed to give in. "Okay."</p>

<p>She grabbed the revolver again and held Krieger at gunpoint, the cold muzzle straight against his skin, in between his eyes.</p>

<p>"Be honest and we'll be merciful."</p>

<p>Krieger remained smug. "Shoot, bitch. I'm not saying a word."</p>

<p>"I don't think you quite understood," Jessie replied, and swung savagely around, slamming him hard across the face with the heavy metal of the handgun.</p><hr />

<p>If it had been a week, it was a month; if it had been a month, it was a year.</p>

<p>James was leaving most of the interrogation to Jessie, for now. The traitor Krieger apparently never realized the kind of temper Jessie had, and was only now discovering the ferocity that had both propelled her to high-rank and which James never ceased to admire. His proud refusal to answer her inquiries was only making it worse for him.</p>

<p>Jessie held the whip from her belt taut. "Well...?" she prompted, stepping around him.</p>

<p>"I'm not telling you shit!" Krieger countered defiantly.</p>

<p>She looped the whip around his throat.</p>

<p>Strangulation had effects not fully appreciable by the onlooker. It centered in a pressure in his head and lungs alongside panic, Krieger's perception fading swiftly for the rising whistle of blood pressure in his ears. He writhed in desperation but the restraints held firm, his chest heaving for breath uselessly, to all of which Jessie only gripped the scourge tighter and pulled it back against his neck like a garrote.</p>

<p>"Talk, damn it!" she ordered.</p>

<p>James looked bored, though he couldn't help a little smile. "Jessie," he said easily, "not to interrupt your fun, darling, but the guy can't talk if he can't breathe."</p>

<p>She appeared to consider this for a moment before letting the lash slacken, releasing him. "You're right. It's counterintuitive."</p>

<p>Krieger coughed and gasped for precious air. He was still struggling for breath when she lifted his head by the chin to face her.</p>

<p>"Cat got your tongue?" asked Jessie delicately.</p>

<p>Before Krieger could think up a good retort, Meowth had appeared on his shoulder. "Not <i>yet</i>," he purred, his eyes squinted.</p>

<p>Krieger licked his lips once, unconsciously, with the first shiver of fear.</p><hr />

<p>If it had been a year, it was a decade; if it had been a decade, it was a century.</p>

<p>And Krieger still held fast.</p>

<p>James, tired of the whole charade, had procured one of the beer bottles from the crates.</p>

<p>"You need a drink already?" Jessie asked. She herself looked frustrated. "Actually that's a good idea. Give me one of those so we can pour it over this guy's head. No, wait; that'd be a waste of beer."</p>

<p>"These are one of those limited edition bottle-caps," James said appreciatively. "I don't think I have one of these."</p>

<p>Jessie eyed him skeptically. "Despite all the time we've been together, I still don't get why you collect bottle caps."</p>

<p>"I like them," was James' easy explanation, and he turned to her. "Honey, do you know where there's an opener around here?"</p>

<p>Jessie found it cute that he was interested in collecting bottle caps, one of the many things she liked about <i>him</i>. She handed him an opener before turning back to their captive with a vicious glare.</p>

<p>"All right, dimwit. Realized the futility of your refusal yet? You know we can only make this worse."</p>

<p>"Much worse," added Meowth with a snarl.</p>

<p>Bruised and bleeding as he was, Krieger's response was still to laugh in their faces.</p>

<p>Jessie and Meowth considered this and turned to James, who was tugging at the bottle of beer. It took a moment for him to have a double-take.</p>

<p>"No Jessie... I took care of the last one," James said.</p>

<p>"The last time we had this problem, <i>you</i> made the guy talk," insisted Jessie.</p>

<p>"The last time I did that," James countered, "it was such a mess we needed to put in a request for new uniforms because even bleach wouldn't work."</p>

<p>"But you're much better at it than I am sweetheart."</p>

<p>"Jess, we both have the same training... maybe Meowth should have a turn." Throughout the conversation, James was still struggling with the beer bottle.</p>

<p>He succeeded in opening the drink to the accompanying sound of a pop and fizz. The other two exchanged a displeased look. Krieger was just staring at them all, listening to them talk with unfolding horror.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled. "Oh sweetie, you're worried for no reason. So what if last time was messy? It's not like anyone will hear him over the ruckus they're making in the bar. And as I said, you have a natural talent with such basics."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Meowth added a yowl, "You're more sophisticated at this than we, so it falls on you."</p>

<p>"<i>Sophisticated</i>," James scowled with disgust. "There's nothing sophisticated about pain, really. You can inflict it with practically anything."</p>

<p>Jessie's blue eyes narrowed in daring. "Mess or no mess, if you don't, I will."</p>

<p>James sighed. He glanced at their prisoner as if appraisingly, then said simply:</p>

<p>"Bring me a towel and ice cubes. Oh, and a hammer."</p>

<p>"Wait," Krieger jumped fearfully, "Please...have mercy! Yes, I was approached to help overthrow Giovanni. There are many of us among Team Rocket's rank-and-file; no one else in your squadron, but there are over thirty of us across Kanto and Johto. We receive our orders through encrypted radio."</p>

<p>"Orders from whom?" James asked placidly.</p>

<p>"A rival syndicate based out of Orre. They call themselves Cipher."</p>

<p>"Who's in charge?" said James.</p>

<p>A moment of gleeful superiority flickered in Krieger's eyes. "That's what everyone wants to know."</p>

<p>"Lucky for us, we have you to put us up to speed."</p>

<p>When he did not reply, James turned casually back to Jessie— "Jessie can you get those things I needed...?" —prompting a return of terrified prescience to their captive. "Look, the head of Cipher is Mr. Rose, all right?"</p>

<p>This drew their attention fast. "Mr. Linford Rose? The former owner of Macro Cosmos?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I guess he told your little group of renegades to steal the Charizard from headquarters?" Jessie leapt in, following the trail to its logical conclusion.</p>

<p>"We were given orders to get the Charizard if we could," he relented, "but the orders weren't given directly by Rose."</p>

<p>James and Jessie both exchanged a glance. They had heard nothing about a rival organization, and the last they knew about Mr. Rose was that he'd fled to Orre, coerced by Giovanni to sell his company holdings for safe passage there – but nothing since.</p>

<p>Krieger was still insisting, "Rose is the leader of Cipher, but he's not who I get my orders from....I swear I don't know <i>who</i> gives the orders! I've told you everything, so please...don't do it!"</p>

<p>"Don't do what?" James asked.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was you were going to do with those things."</p>

<p>James blinked, as if mystified. "I just wanted to crush ice for my drink."</p>

<p>Jessie's smile was turning into a grin, and Meowth was purring loudly and coiling his tail. It took a moment for Krieger to realize the whole thing had been an elaborately preconceived trick.</p>

<p>"Oh shit," Krieger muttered, and sank deeper into the chair.</p>

<p>Jessie kissed her companion's lips lightly. "I tell you James, you've got a way."</p>

<p>"How long have we been here?" James asked himself, and the three of them crowded around his transceiver for the time.</p>

<p>"It's only been...thirty minutes. What the fuck." Jessie turned to the others casually. "Anyway are we all satisfied here?"</p>

<p>"I think we're good," said James, giving a little shrug.</p>

<p>Meowth yawned. "Yeah, I wanna get home already."</p>

<p>In less than a blink of an eye Jessie snatched up the revolver from the table. Mercy had the speed of a gunshot – if it had been a minute, it was a second; if it was a second, it was merely a heartbeat.</p><hr />

<p>Ash heard the shot, echoing clear against the alley's brick walls, however he was not sure at first what it was he had heard.</p>

<p>Saffron City was still inaccessible thanks to the unofficial toll, so Ash's intended detour to Lavender Town would ideally provide access to Saffron through an alternate road – that of route 8.</p>

<p>It was the principle of the thing. If he hoped to get eight badges to challenge the Elite Four, he needed to traverse these gatehouses, yet the idea of paying the notorious mafia syndicate a fee for use of the public road was so distasteful to him that he would rather seek out an unorthodox way through even if it put him back a couple of days.</p>

<p>The road from Vermillion to Lavender, and consequently to Saffron, was an ostensibly straight path. Still, it was one of the longest treks he had yet taken, two day's travel that stretched across grassy trails and down several boardwalks overlooking a seaside vista.</p>

<p>At least the weather was good and they spied several varieties of wild Pokémon. There were so many that Ash briefly entertained the idea of eschewing his planned solo-run of the Elite Four to catch some, but he was in quite a hurry to get to his destination and so, for that matter, was Pikachu. They therefore tried to skirt any battles along the way, which was probably inadvisable considering any gained experience would be helpful for the gym matches.</p>

<p>Ash eventually reached Lavender Town and got a room at the Pokémon Center's lodge to spend the night. It was there that he overheard two trainers discussing a wild Marowak they brought to the Pokémon Center after finding it had been injured from a gunshot.</p>

<p>"It was <i>shot</i>?" Ash had exclaimed. Considering Marowak were such rare Pokémon as it was, the idea was outrageous. "Who would do such a thing?"</p>

<p>The other trainers hadn't wanted to say at first, but he coaxed the information from them eventually. "I saw them fleeing. They were wearing a Team Rocket uniform."</p>

<p><i>Of course,</i> thought Ash, <i>it had to be Team Rocket.</i> And when he retired to sleep he was still fuming about the organization and their callous disregard towards Pokémon wellbeing.</p>

<p>The unpleasant thought of that cruelty, however, kept Ash awake. He lay in bed mulling over Team Rocket, and it was about five past midnight when Pikachu gave a small squeak from where it was curled up beside him.</p>

<p>"You can't get to sleep either, huh Pikachu?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pika</i>," replied the little animal. Ash petted it on the head.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Ash agreed, "I keep thinking about that hurt Marowak too."</p>

<p>Pikachu gave a squeaky growl and stretched.</p>

<p>Ash reflected on it. "Maybe a nighttime stroll would help us both," he decided.</p>

<p>That was how Ash was compelled out into the night. Pikachu scampered along at his heels and followed Ash all the way to the side street with the tavern.</p>

<p>It was not the safest part of town, let alone walking down that dark alley like if it were Lavender's main street, but Pikachu was sufficient protection. What he did not expect was noise like a firecracker, or for a narrow portion of the tavern's back wall to give way readily as he leant against one of the bricks.</p>

<p>Against his better judgement, Ash examined the short passageway he had uncovered, walking into the warehouse room in time to see James tossing a rose to a slumped figure, Jessie remarking something about how tedious their night's work had been, and Meowth lifting his ears at Ash's presence and give an alerting mew to the two humans.</p>

<p>When Ash realized what the scene before him was, he froze. When their attention shot towards him, his breath caught short.</p>

<p>Instead of the civilian clothes he had first seen them in, now they wore their full uniforms, brazen white with accented black patent-leather. It was oddly impressive; the same halting kind of awe at seeing a dangerous jungle beast at arm's length, poised to pounce. Somehow too Ash had never imagined they were high-rank.</p>

<p>James shot an accusatory look towards Meowth. "I thought you said there was no other entrance!"</p>

<p>Meowth flattened his ears. "Hey what're you looking at me for? How was I supposed to know there was a secret passage?"</p>

<p>Ash blinked in surprise. "Did...did your Meowth just talk?"</p>

<p>Jessie frowned at him. "Listen twerp, this is Team Rocket business; stay out of it."</p>

<p>To this, Ash was taken by ill-advised indignation. "Like trying to kill that Marowak still recovering at the Pokémon Center? Stealing its cub? Now you've moved to people; you're making progress."</p>

<p>The instant he blurted this out, he realized he shouldn't have. Even Pikachu gave him a disapproving look.</p>

<p>"I think you've seen a little too much here," Jessie added calmly, taking a step forward as Ash took a step back. "You'd better prepare for trouble."</p>

<p>"Make that double," James chimed in, right beside her.</p>

<p>"That's right!" hissed Meowth, taking a huge leap towards Ash's eyes.</p>

<p>Ash ducked, and the cat succeeded only in knocking his cap off his head; Pikachu instantly leapt to defend his trainer, tackling Meowth backwards, and they ended up in a ball of screeching, flying fur.</p>

<p>"Get him, Arbok!" ordered Jessie, throwing a Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"Go, Weezing!" added James.</p>

<p>The three animals instantly surrounded Ash, with defiant little Pikachu trapped in the center. Jessie and James both laughed loudly at the sight of this seemingly evident futility.</p>

<p>"You really think you can take us on with one Pokémon?" mocked Jessie.</p>

<p>Whether Ash thought he could, or could not, was soon irrelevant. Pikachu bounded straight up, and in one sudden electrical shock threw them all against the wall, even farther back than the day they first met at the Cerulean Pokémon Center. Wood crates crashed to the floor accompanied by the piercing sound of shattered glass, and beer poured out.</p>

<p>Arbok and Weezing had been knocked out in a single blast of electricity. Only Meowth remained, standing unsteadily with a sliver of strength. "<i>Me</i>...owww..."</p>

<p>"That Pikachu is no ordinary Pikachu," marvelled James.</p>

<p>They were still angry, but at the same time they now appeared curious. It was strangely more unnerving to Ash than if they had been completely filled with rage.</p>

<p>"Maybe we've been hasty," Jessie set forth. "Would you like to join Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>Ash just stared at them, astounded. "...I'll think about it," he replied, too incredulous to utter anything else.</p>

<p>"Well then, get outta here before we change our minds," said James.</p>

<p>He wasn't about to argue the point. Ash picked up his cap from the floor and ran out of there as fast as his legs could carry him, with Pikachu at his heels.</p>

<p>"Wonder how that Pikachu got so strong?" asked Jessie.</p>

<p>James shrugged his shoulders, "Let's us hurry back to the boss, Jess, before we attract any more unwanted attention."</p>

<p>The trio exited the building and was soon lost in the shadows.</p><hr />

<p>Delia was in her dining room setting the table when her son Ash called her on the phone.</p>

<p>"Hey Mom!" he greeted her enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Hello my boy!" his mother said as she balanced the phone to one ear and simultaneously placed a plate of food at the table, "How have you been?"</p>

<p>"Okay," he said simply, "but I've had some tense moments...I crossed paths with the Rocket people a couple of times."</p>

<p>"You've had run-ins with Team Rocket?" There was sudden pallor on her face.</p>

<p>"You don't know the half of it," Ash said, though he did not sound very concerned at all, "I walked into a storage area and I found them with someone who was badly injured...maybe dead. Anyway, they told me to get out of there so I did."</p>

<p>"Ash, I'd prefer it if you stayed clear of them." Delia spoke with urgency bordering upon desperation. "There's something you don't know."</p>

<p>"Like what?" he asked.</p>

<p>Briefly, she hesitated, as if weighing an admission or lack thereof. At last she just said, "Never mind."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me Mom," Ash assured. "Anyway, Pikachu and I have got to get going if we want to reach Saffron by nightfall. We've already got two badges already...just six more left to go. I'll talk to you soon, bye!"</p>

<p>He hung up and Delia sat down at the table to her dinner, but she felt as if her appetite was waning.</p>

<p>She sighed and whispered to herself, "I need to tell him."</p>

<p>Having received word from Team Rocket headquarters about the supposedly 'most powerful Pokémon of all' being sighted somewhere about the Sevii Islands, an archipelago located in the oceans between Johto and Kanto, Archer set out immediately with the troop of cadets. This was a top priority and, at least as the minions saw it, an all-expenses-paid trip to the Johtonian seashore.</p>

<p>The latter view annoyed Archer. To his businesslike sensibilities, which still felt aggrieved at any damage their image had suffered at Azalea, they had no time for frivolity. If they had, it would be <em>after</em> they had caught the Legendary Pokémon – not before.</p>

<p>"This isn't a vacation," he snapped, seeing how they all jostled to buy trinkets when they came to an open-air flea market. "It's a business trip. We catch the Pokémon, bring it to Giovanni, and then maybe we can return home to the Kanto region." He was feeling nostalgic – nostalgia, was that the right word? – for Celadon City. Johto, for all its prettiness and admirable qualities, did not hold the same personal connection to him as the cities of Kanto.</p>

<p>In the middle of his lecturing Archer was approached by someone familiar.</p>

<p>Archer sighed. "Hi Kris. You're in Olivine too, I see?"</p>

<p>Kris was straightforward. "I need to get to Cianwood so I can challenge the Olivine gym."</p>

<p>"You mean get to Cianwood to challenge the <em>Cianwood</em> gym," Archer corrected.</p>

<p>"Do they have a gym in Cianwood too?" she asked blankly.</p>

<p>Against his better judgment, Archer ventured, "Why would you need to go to Cianwood to challenge Olivine's gym?"</p>

<p>"To catch a Shuckle," Kris replied, as cheery as ever.</p>

<p>Archer was trying to figure this out when Kris relented and explained:</p>

<p>"When I came to Olivine this morning, I headed straight for the gym. The receptionist told me Jasmine – she's the gym leader – is on temporary leave and had gone to the lighthouse."</p>

<p>"Okay," Archer said, following her story.</p>

<p>"I went to the lighthouse and found Jasmine at the top with a sick Ampharos. Ampharos is the lighthouse Pokémon."</p>

<p>"I guess that's important here?"</p>

<p>"For hundreds of years Olivine City has always had an electric type Pokémon living at the lighthouse. Anyway she says Ampharos fell sick like a week ago. No one knows why but the Pokémon Center nurse said it could be a sensitivity to some kind of radio wave."</p>

<p>"I should mention this to Dr. Colress. Maybe it'd be useful."</p>

<p>"Apparently they think something in milk can cure the Ampharos, so Jasmine asked me if I could run to the dairy farm outside Olivine to get some, and she'll cut her leave short and get back to her post at the gym."</p>

<p>"Why not go to the Mart?"</p>

<p>"The Mart was out," Kris said. "When I got to the dairy farm the farmer told me he <em>also</em> has sick Pokémon, so they haven't been able to produce milk for a week and he's desperate for his own business. It looks like the same ailment."</p>

<p>"Even more important to mention to Colress."</p>

<p>"Of course Miltank are different from Ampharos; the only thing that can heal the Miltank is a special kind of fermented berry juice. The farmer said he'd give me milk for free if I could get some juice for his cows."</p>

<p>"So go back to the Mart."</p>

<p>"Except the Mart is all out of juice too. They tell me however that it's very easy to make it yourself if you have a Shuckle. It's a kind of Pokémon only found on Cianwood Island." Kris beamed. "So now I'm off to Cianwood."</p>

<p>"Forgive my practicality, but why not just walk one route back to Ecruteak and see if they have milk in the grocery stores there?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure they do."</p>

<p>"Then...?"</p>

<p>"I wanna see what a Shuckle looks like."</p>

<p>Archer opened his mouth to say something, then stopped to consider whether it was even worth it before deciding, "Actually, no, I have nothing to say to this. Go to Cianwood."</p>

<p>"That's kind of why I was mentioning it. I only have an Eevee..."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"I have no way to get across the ocean to Cianwood Island."</p>

<p>"Evolve your Eevee into a Vaporeon."</p>

<p>"No water stone. Besides, poor Eevee."</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can help you with your travelling woes."</p>

<p>"I overheard some of your people saying you're heading towards the Sevii Islands."</p>

<p>"Who, pray tell, so I can punish them for talking too much?"</p>

<p>Kris didn't answer. "I hoped I could hitch a ride on your boat."</p>

<p>"Not happening," replied Archer.</p>

<p>"Eevee and I wouldn't interfere," she said, "We could even help out."</p>

<p>"We already have enough hands on deck," Archer said pointedly. "Look, talk to some of the fishermen down at the wharf. One of them might give you a fishing rod so you can catch a water type and use that to swim across."</p><hr />

<p>Archer figured he'd shooed Kris off till a couple of hours later, when their ship was getting ready to set sail and she appeared on the dock with her Eevee.</p>

<p>"I talked to the fishermen."</p>

<p>"Did you, now?"</p>

<p>"One of them said since the grocery store is low on supplies, he was willing to trade me an old rod for a half-gallon of milk, and..."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Just get on the fucking boat," scowled Archer.</p>

<p>The Team Rocket ship set off uneventfully from the port. Everyone accepted Kris as practically already one of Team Rocket, which would not have bothered Archer too much were it not for the fact he kept admonishing the minions to not talk so loosely about Team Rocket business, and here they were accepting this outsider so carelessly. Yet he already had the idea he would invite her to join, if that is what she wanted; he merely wished to feel out her motives.</p>

<p>Archer joined Kris on deck where she was watching the Tentacool drift around carried aimlessly by the waves. The sun glinted on the seawater and Eevee, sitting atop a barrel, seemed to be enjoying the salty freshness of the surf.</p>

<p>"Kris?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Why do you even want to join Team Rocket? Do you even know what you'd be doing, really?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'd do the same things you do."</p>

<p>"I do a lot, Kris."</p>

<p>There it was again, that nagging impression of his that she had a patent naïveté to the world, and a carelessness unsuited to crude realities. "Have you heard stories at all about the kind of business Team Rocket engages in?"</p>

<p>"I know Team Rocket relocates Pokémon."</p>

<p>"Relocates. Yes." <em>Good euphemism for theft, but I still think she's not cut out to be Team Rocket material,</em> Archer thought, adding tentatively, "There's more than that."</p>

<p>"Yes, more than that, but every organization sometimes has to liquidate liabilities."</p>

<p>
  <em>Scratch that. She's perfect for Team Rocket.</em>
</p><hr />

<p>It was nightfall by the time they reached Cianwood. Archer was restless; however, continuing a voyage across rough waves such as the whirlpool-laden waters surrounding Cianwood was inadvisable at night, so it behooved them to make port and be patient till the sun came up and made sailing easier. Patience of course, was one of the virtues that eluded him.</p>

<p>The other was perhaps humility, not for himself so much as his organization. Capturing a Legendary Pokémon would only affirm the magnificence of Team Rocket in Archer's view. For tonight at least, his imagination of such grand accomplishments made all the stupidities and failings of their agents-in-training capable of being overlooked.</p>

<p>The nighttime lights of the small island village sparkled like starlight across its sandy paths, and traditional residences spread out at walking distance from the seashore. It was a quaint town that had as its main source of income the fishing trade, as well as rare medicines that were an exclusivity from the isle's natural flora and fauna.</p>

<p>Unable to sleep, Archer's inquietude led him out to the beach where he strolled along with Houndoom keeping him company. Attired in the white syndicate uniform, people kept away – the few people who were out at this moonlit hour anyway. Everything was peaceful, and a nocturnal Pokémon like Houndoom always enjoyed talking a walk at night, as did Archer himself admittedly.</p>

<p>He had not expected to go very far from their ship, but when he saw what looked like a gleam of crystal light racing in the distance, he changed his plans.</p>

<p>Archer ended up at a rocky alcove erosion had carved into the island's cliffs, before which he found none other than Kris, and the wild Suicune – and another trainer, whom Archer did not know.</p>

<p>Even at night the creature's fur shimmered ethereally. It was watching the two humans quarrel.</p>

<p>"That Suicune is mine," the man snapped.</p>

<p>"No it isn't. Suicune is wild," Kris countered.</p>

<p>"In that case, we'll battle to show it who's more worthy as a trainer, you or me."</p>

<p>Her opponent unlocked a Poké Ball, a knowing smirk on his face. From where he stood, Archer frowned; with the assured way he carried himself, this trainer looked experienced enough to out-level Kris' lone Eevee and probably carried a full team of six Pokémon.</p>

<p>"I don't even know who you are," said Kris honestly.</p>

<p>"Gary Oak from Pallet Town. And there's no way I'm losing!"</p>

<p>Suicune was glancing between Gary and Kris as the latter protested.</p>

<p>"But don't you see fighting is pointless?" Kris replied, "Suicune can pick whomever it wants for a trainer. Or maybe it just wants to be free."</p>

<p>The Suicune, with a mischievous little cry, sprang forward to poke one of Kris' empty Poké Balls with its nose. Before anyone could react it opened the capsule and was drawn in with a flash of light.</p>

<p>Everyone froze in shock as the Poké Ball's red indicator light flickered a few times, the sphere not shaking at all, before registering as caught. Then it was Gary who gave the first utterance; it was less coherent and more a frustrated exclamation of outrage.</p>

<p>"I guess that solves that," figured Kris.</p>

<p>"No it doesn't! How can a Pokémon choose its master? It's unheard of."</p>

<p>"Actually in Unova, the legendary dragon Pokémon selected their own—"</p>

<p>"We're in Johto, not Unova! And Suicune is not a dragon." Gary was furious. "I can't believe it! Without even a challenge? The Legendary Beasts belong with a future Champion, not some rookie trainer with a pet Eevee."</p>

<p>"It's in my Poké Ball now," she replied with a shrug.</p>

<p>Gary eyed the capsule. "You know, Poké Ball registration numbers can be forged."</p>

<p>She stared at him wide-eyed. "You saw it walk up to me!"</p>

<p>"Actually, the only people who saw that are you – and me."</p>

<p>What was he considering? He never got so far. Archer stepped into the open.</p>

<p>"Ready to go, Kris?" Archer prompted.</p>

<p>She sprinted over to his side as Gary stared at them, his face blanching. "You're part of Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as a matter of fact, we both are," Archer replied smoothly, and the look of appreciation Kris shot him did not go unnoticed, "Is that something your Pokémon would like to take up with us?"</p>

<p>Houndoom was growling in anticipation of the fight. Gary took a disarming step back, but there was a spark of sheer resentment in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Whatever… Suicune is yours," Gary relented.</p>

<p>They walked away together, back down the beach. Kris turned to Archer and asked, "Am I really part of Team Rocket now?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we should make it official. Would you like to join Team Rocket?" asked Archer.</p>

<p>"Would I ever!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Then I'll see to it you're brought in. After all, it's better for us to recruit the trainer than steal the Pokémon," he quipped, with a motion towards Suicune's Poké Ball.</p><hr />

<p>The next day was bright and sunny. They set sail as soon as the sun was up, with their newest crewmate practically bouncing with excitement. All the cadets were happy to have her officially part of the team – because she still apparently had like three boxes of cookies left – and Archer was happy to be able to report to Giovanni that they now had a trainer with a Suicune on their side. Things were going great for Team Rocket in Johto.</p>

<p>Kris was fitted with one of the black Team Rocket uniforms, and once she had dressed was told to report to Archer.</p>

<p>Archer filled her in on their present mission. "The Tanoby Ruins are abandoned, ancient temples within the Sevii Islands archipelago," he explained as he showed her a map. "A contact of ours sighted a Legendary Pokémon in the area, one that Giovanni has been after. It's our job to trap it and bring it back to the boss."</p>

<p>"What kind of Pokémon?" asked Kris.</p>

<p>"Mew."</p>

<p>Kris glanced at her Pokédex and searched for the species name. An artist's rendering of a small catlike Pokémon displayed onscreen as well as the following information:</p>

<p>
<i>Mew<br />
Type: Psychic<br />
This Pokémon is said to be extinct. Because it was able to use every known move, many scientists believe Mew was the prehistoric ancestor of all Pokémon. </i>
</p>

<p>"It says Mew is extinct," she remarked.</p>

<p>"That's what everyone thinks," smiled Archer. "We've got evidence that there's at least one left. Ancient carvings within the Tanoby Ruins depict Mew, so if there's any place to start a hunt, it would be there. That's where you'll be a help...Mew is said to be the most powerful Pokémon in the world. If we end up in a battle with it, another legendary like your Suicune might be the only thing strong enough to fight it."</p>

<p>"Then how did you ever expect to catch it before we had Suicune?"</p>

<p>"The way we <i>still</i> expect to catch it," replied Archer, "through cleverness. However, any confrontation should be easier now."</p>

<p>They arrived at their destination within a couple of hours and disembarked. Eevee strutted ahead, leading the way for its trainer.</p>

<p>The Sevii Islands each had a small village settlement, but for the most part were rather untamed. Wild Pokémon flourished here, of unique and rare varieties, and Archer could absolutely imagine a supposedly extinct Pokémon having hidden itself away in the inviolability of these forests for years unknownst to man. Being in the ocean some distance southward, the climate on these isles was warmer than the temperate-northern of the Kanto and Johto regions, but not to the oppressive heat of tropical Hoenn.</p>

<p>After trekking through the foliage for some time, they reached the far end of the island and at a signal from Archer, the cadets spread out to search the ruins here. Archer himself made directly for the main temple, which stood as an imposing monument among its smaller brethren. Kris accompanied him.</p>

<p>"What were these temples ever built for?" she wondered as they stepped through its columned portico.</p>

<p>"No one really knows. Most people think they were built by ancient civilizations that worshipped Pokémon," explained Archer.</p>

<p>Eevee gave a cry from ahead, and they walked over to find the Pokémon gazing up at an image carved into the stone. It depicted a feline creature that looked much like the artwork of Mew in Kris' Pokédex.</p>

<p>"Well there's the carving of Mew," said Archer. "Now to find the real thing."</p>

<p>They looked around for some other clue, then something caught their eyes.</p>

<p>Off to the side were a number of small Pokémon called Unown, which floated together in a sociable cluster. Neither Kris nor Archer knew what they were. "Maybe those Pokémon could help us," Kris speculated.</p>

<p>"It's worth a shot," figured Archer.</p>

<p>They were an unusual species, with flat bodies in different letterlike shapes and a single eye in their center, yet despite their otherwise alien appearance they seemed like friendly beings. When they noticed Kris and Archer approaching, they came over to meet them as if equally drawn by curiosity.</p>

<p>"Hi!" greeted Kris.</p>

<p>The Pokémon squeaked happily and shifted about their position. With their figures they spelled the word:</p>

<p>HELLO</p>

<p>"Aren't they cute? And they're so intelligent...they can actually write!"</p>

<p>A young Unown that looked like a letter R had taken an interest in the red R on their shirts. It flitted around as Kris pointed her Pokédex at the nondescript little animal.</p>

<p>
  <i>Unown<br />
Type: Psychic<br />
Different forms of Unown exist. When alone, nothing happens. However, if there are two or more, an odd power is said to emerge.</i>
</p>

<p>Archer frowned skeptically. "That sounds either intriguing or worrying," he said.</p>

<p>"What are a group of you called?" asked Kris.</p>

<p>ALPHABET</p>

<p>"Actually, I should've seen that coming," considered Kris.</p>

<p>The alphabet, as they were, shifted about again to spell:</p>

<p>CHOSEN BY SUICUNE WELCOME TO OUR HOME</p>

<p>"They know about the Legendary Pokémon with us," she remarked with astonishment.</p>

<p>Archer mulled this over. "If they know about one Legendary Pokémon... then perhaps they know about others." He turned to the Unown. "Have you seen a Pokémon called Mew?"</p>

<p>WHY</p>

<p>"Because...I would like to meet a Mew," explained Archer, oddly self-conscious at having to explain himself to wild Pokémon.</p>

<p>The Unown all looked at each other and chattered softly. Archer got the odd feeling they were discussing him in a huddle. Then they arranged themselves:</p>

<p>DOES MEW WANT TO MEET YOU</p>

<p>"Ok, this is stupid," decided Archer. "We're evidently getting nowhere with the epistolary."</p>

<p>The Unown squeaked, and suddenly spread out to encircle the two humans.</p>

<p>There was a flash of blinding light, and suddenly Kris and Archer warped to a forest grotto. Rays of sunlight, at an angle insinuating it was already late afternoon, shone brilliantly through dappled leaves, and within the center was a stone relic. The Unown had seemingly vanished.</p>

<p>Kris turned accusatorily towards Archer. "Why'd you insult them?"</p>

<p>"I didn't insult them! Well, not in so many words," Archer added reluctantly. "Where are we anyway?"</p>

<p>"You're in Agate Town."</p>

<p>They glanced up to see a lady who had entered the grotto through a side cave passageway. She was slender, with long blonde hair and no-nonsense green eyes; Archer felt he should recognize her, but could not place from where. For her part she looked quite surprised, as if she had not expected anyone else to be here. At her heels was a Glaceon, an ice-type Eevee evolution.</p>

<p>Her statement, however, took a moment to sink in. "Orre? We're in the Orre region?" echoed Archer.</p>

<p>"That's almost on the other side of the globe," said Kris, eyes wide. "We're from Johto."</p>

<p>"Did the Pokémon of the forest bring you here?" the woman asked.</p>

<p>"What...Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"Relic Forest is considered sacred. It's said to be a place of purification, the dwelling place of a mystical creature that can heal even mortal wounds or ailments." She was regarding them cautiously and Archer realized she had noticed their uniforms. Team Rocket was known worldwide. Whether they were loved or hated, respected or feared...that was what made the difference.</p>

<p>Kris' Eevee showed no qualms. It scampered happily over to the Glaceon, which recognizing the younger of its kind, gave a happy cry of greeting and touched noses with it. The woman glanced down at it and her guarded expression was tempered with a small smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I can see you raise your Pokémon like a friend – it's so lively. I don't know either of you personally; I know your employer, but I don't think that should matter now. My name's Oleana." She held out a hand to them. "Mrs. Oleana Rose."</p>

<p>When Mr. Rose discovered Oleana had invited the two Team Rocket agents to their home in Agate Town he was cordial towards them but his skepticism could not be hidden. He welcomed their guests in to sit and have a drink in the parlor and then discreetly took Oleana aside to ask her what she meant by this.</p>

<p>"They say wild Pokémon teleported them to the Relic Forest," explained Oleana.</p>

<p>"I don't buy it. I say they're spies," Rose responded, "probably sent to chart new territory for Giovanni."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she conceded, "but either way it would behoove us to keep a close eye on them until we know for sure."</p>

<p>"You're right about that, Oleana." Rose pondered for a moment. "I wonder if he found out about our deal with the Silph Company?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Archer watched Rose and Oleana from afar. They were out of hearing range at present, and he could only speculate what they were talking about; no doubt it was about them. However, the good thing about that was they couldn't hear what he and Kris discussed right now either.</p>

<p>The Roses residence at Agate Town was unique. It was a three-story house tucked away beneath the roots of what once had been a massive sequoia tree, with a clear view of the mountain creek that wove deftly through the village and down crystalline cascades to the pond. Archer thought the place cozy, both by its exterior appearance and interior comforts. He noticed guards patrolling the outside of the house, all wearing purple bandanas around their necks. The guards didn't faze him; Giovanni had guards everywhere, but the bandanas wear a unique touch, almost like the uniforms Team Rocket wore.</p>

<p>"Do you know these people?" Kris asked Archer, when he glanced at her. "You seemed to recognize Oleana back there in the forest grotto."</p>

<p>Archer nodded affirmingly. "Mr. Rose is the former CEO of Macro Cosmos. Oleana had been his right-hand."</p>

<p>"Macro Cosmos," mused Kris, "doesn't Team Rocket own that company now?"</p>

<p>"It was one of our early acquisitions in the Poké Ball industry," Archer answered. "Both Rose and his wife Oleana are technically wanted in Galar; do you remember hearing what happened over there with some kind of alien Pokémon called Eternatus?"</p>

<p>Kris gave a small nod, and Archer went on:</p>

<p>"Giovanni coerced Rose to sell his company through manipulating that scandal. Orre has no extradition treaties, and Rose and Oleana have had the good sense to stay far away from Team Rocket's business since they moved here. However, because of how our past negotiations with them went, I wouldn't wholeheartedly trust them either."</p>

<p>Mr. Rose and his wife Oleana made their way back into the parlor area followed by a butler who carried a tray with four goblets and a bottle of sparkling apple cider. They sat down as the butler opened the bottle, filled the glasses and walked out of the room.  Archer noticed the butler was wearing a purple bandana. <i>It looks just like the ones worn by the guards patrolling the house,</i> he thought.</p>

<p>"My wife Oleana told me that you two had been transported to this region by Unowns," Rose commented.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Archer, "We were far away, came across them and before we knew it, here we were."</p>

<p>Rose and Oleana glanced at each other and Rose asked, "Where did you say you were from?"</p>

<p>"It was an island with ruins," Archer answered briefly; the question made him a little nervous. <i>How the hell can we get out of here fast? Without appearing rude?</i> he thought.</p>

<p>As if sensing his nervousness, Kris decided to change the conversation. Her eyes caught sight of two very large wolves that were lounging on a rug nearby. They had blue fur and piercing yellow eyes.</p>

<p>"What beautiful animals!" she said in admiration. Are these the famous Legendary Pokémon from Galar?"</p>

<p>"Yes...these are Zacian and Zamazenta," affirmed Oleana.</p>

<p> "How did you ever catch them?" Kris asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't actually catch them. They just selected me as their trainer," she replied modestly.</p>

<p>Archer worried Kris would bring up her Suicune, but she held her tongue, already showing more prudence than the rest of the cadets back at Johto. He began wondering how those recruits were doing. They must have realized his absence by now. Knowing them, they were probably conjuring up extravagant scenarios of death and danger instead of the somewhat embarrassing reality of him getting kidnapped by Unowns.</p>

<p>Archer felt a sudden sense of urgency. Why, he did not know; what he did know was that the entire situation was making him uneasy and he wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your hospitality," he said, "But we really need to get going..." he stood up and everyone followed his lead. Mr. Rose extended his hand and Archer shook it.</p>

<p>"Do come back for a visit sometime," Oleana told Kris, "Perhaps for a bit longer; and I will give you a tour of the grounds."</p>

<p>"Thank you, we'll keep it in mind," said Kris good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"My chauffeur can drive you into town, if you need it," Mr. Rose told them as he and Oleana escorted them to the front door.</p>

<p>"That is very kind, yes. Thanks again," Archer said as he put his hand on Kris' back and gently urged her out the door. As far as he was concerned, he couldn't get out of there fast enough.</p>

<p>Rose snapped his fingers at one of the guards standing outside. "Chauffeur, please," he ordered and in less than a minute, the chauffeur stood before him awaiting instructions. "Take them into town, drop them off where ever they like, and then return here."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," the man said, and without speaking to Archer or Kris, he walked quickly to a limousine and opened the door in expectation of passengers. Archer did not disappoint. He took Kris' hand and led her to the car where they both quickly got into.</p>

<p>Oleana waved to them, Rose by her side, as they stood watching them leave. Kris waved back.</p><hr />

<p>"Why were you so stressed?" she whispered to Archer as the chauffeur pulled the limousine away from the house and drove out, "I could sense the anxiety coming off you in waves."</p>

<p>"Because," he whispered back, "It felt just like when we go visit Giovanni in his office... did you notice that he didn't have one or two body guards, but rather a dozen...all wearing purple kerchiefs around their necks." He paused, and then added, "It looked like some kind of uniform."</p>

<p>Kris didn't answer, and the rest of the trip in the car was very quiet. The chauffeur said nothing to them during the entire trip until they arrived where the downtown area began and then asked, "Where to, sir?"</p>

<p>"The Pokémon Center, please," Archer replied.</p>

<p>The limousine arrived at the Pokémon Center five minutes later and the chauffeur pulled up to the entrance. "Sir, we have arrived," the driver simply informed them.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Archer as he and Kris got out of the car. As soon as they closed the door, the driver drove away.</p>

<p>Archer and Kris went into the Pokémon Center to notify Giovanni. He didn't want to call from Rose's residence, figuring it would be best that their conversation be kept with a modicum of privacy.</p>

<p>While he took the telephone receiver in one hand and set to dialling with the other, he overheard two novice trainers who were seated nearby as they conversed.</p>

<p>"I caught a glimpse of the forest guardian yesterday. It was attracted by the cookies I was eating. I guess it's fond of sweet food."</p>

<p>"You're so lucky! I'd love to see a Mew..."</p>

<p>The moment Archer heard that, he froze. He glanced over and, as charming as possible, inquired:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to be discussing the Legendary Pokémon of Relic Forest, would you?"</p>

<p>They both jumped as if startled by his being there. "Please pretend you never heard us discussing it!" the first entreated.</p>

<p>"It's supposed to be a village secret. Mew protects the forest and Agate Town," the second told him.</p>

<p>"Oh don't worry, I wouldn't dream of telling anyone..." assured Archer with a smile.</p>

<p><i>...except the boss,</i> he thought slyly as the other trainers departed the Pokémon Center, returning to the immersion of their conversation, and he turned back to dialling the telephone. He could hardly believe his good fortune.</p>

<p>Giovanni had, unsuprisingly, heard from the minions by now about Archer's disappearance, and while glad to know he was not in any danger, the Team Rocket boss had understandable questions.</p>

<p>"Archer. What are you doing in Orre?"</p>

<p>"We got teleported here by some wild Pokémon."</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Giovanni asked, rather with annoyance:</p>

<p>"Why did you offend Unowns?"</p>

<p>"I didn't <i>set out</i> to offend them," justified Archer. "...How did you know they were Unowns?"</p>

<p>"Because only Unowns would do something like that of their own accord," explained Giovanni. "They're as mischievous as Zorua and explorers are warned to never approach a wild Unown unless it's alone. When you see a bunch of Unowns in one place, you're supposed to stay clear of them."</p>

<p><i>Now we're told this,</i> Archer reflected crossly.</p>

<p>"I'll send a helicopter to pick you up," said Giovanni matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"Do you think we can delay it enough for us to follow up on something we've heard?" Archer asked, "Mew is apparently here in this town. They've been hiding it like some kind of village protector all this time."</p>

<p>"Interesting."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," concurred Archer emphatically. "All we have to do is flush it out and lure it into a battle."</p>

<p>He could almost envision the fierce delight sparking in Giovanni's eyes. "Then you and Kris will set out to capture the Pokémon. I'll get the helicopter to pass by the Relic Forest at about midnight Orre-time. Get the Mew and be on it."</p>

<p>So saying, Giovanni hung up the telephone.</p>

<p>Archer left the Pokémon Center to find Kris outside with her Pokémon. Eevee was scampering playfully around Suicune, practically underpaw as both Pokémon vied to be fed berries by their trainer. "What's the word from the boss?" asked Kris as she saw Archer approach her.</p>

<p>"Change of plans," he said firmly. "We're getting into the Relic Forest and swiping a Mew."</p>

<p>"Finally, a real mission!" exclaimed Kris. He grimaced at her exuberance.</p>

<p>"Not so loud," he snapped, "or else all the townspeople will know!"</p>

<p>"Oh. Sorry, Archer."</p>

<p>"You know all those Lava Cookies you bought?"</p>

<p>"I've only got a few left," Kris replied.</p>

<p>"...A <i>few</i>?" He gave her a questioning look. "I thought you had three boxes."</p>

<p>"Eevee and I binged them on the boat so that they wouldn't get swiped by pickpockets. You know you have a surprising amount of thieves in the crew."</p>

<p>Archer bit back a retort. "How many cookies do you have left?"</p>

<p>"Half a box."</p>

<p>"Good enough. That's our bait for the Mew," smirked Archer. "We'll need your Suicune's help as well, just like we expected back at the Tanoby Ruins. I'll fill you in."</p><hr />

<p>Archer and Kris stayed at the Pokémon Center till the clock struck midnight. Then they strolled to the Relic Forest.</p>

<p>The forest was at walking distance, connected to the rest of Agate Town via a narrow cavern passageway with rocky features lined by moss and smooth ground. Kris was accompanied by her two Pokémon, Eevee and Suicune, which were contentedly walking outside of their Poké Balls. They all emerged in the woodland grotto.</p>

<p>Moonlight shone ethereally like a spotlight illuminating the ancient stone relic in the center of the forest. As they approached, Archer reviewed the surroundings. The place was peaceful but there were no signs of any Pokémon.</p>

<p>Kris had retrieved a handful of Lava Cookies from her bag. "What are we supposed to do with the cookies? Just leave them here?"</p>

<p>Archer was debating this when movement amidst the trees caught his eye, and just then the Mew appeared.</p>

<p>The Pokémon floated in mid-air through psychic ability. It was a small animal that looked like a kitten, with pastel pink fur and a tail as long as its body; so delicate in form it hardly seemed fit to be considered the world's most powerful Pokémon, but Archer knew to never judge a Liepard by its spots. It gave a friendly mew, alert to the cookies.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you want cookies?" Kris offered it some.</p>

<p>Archer was less patient. "Now, attack with Suicune before it gets away!" he snapped.</p>

<p>Kris glanced at him a bit uncertainly yet she obeyed quickly.</p>

<p>"Suicune, Aurora Beam!" cried Kris.</p>

<p>The leopard arched backwards and unleashed a shimmering ray of ice. Frosty clouds of evaporation bloomed in its wake as the beam struck Mew head-on. The little Pokémon squeaked, tumbling backwards in mid-air.</p>

<p>Before it barely had a chance to right itself, Archer acted fast. He pulled out a metal restraining ring, snapping it open before hurling it at the Mew. It closed around the creature; when Mew tried to struggle loose it squealed as electricity coursed through it, and it slumped limply in its prison.</p>

<p>"I thought we'd just use a Poké Ball," Kris protested.</p>

<p>Archer shook his head. "We don't want it getting away and we don't have any Master Ball with us. Besides, we can heal it once we get it back to headquarters."</p>

<p>Kris looked at the Mew, now lying injured in the trap, without agreement but not about to argue.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a clear voice shouting from behind them. "...the Mew!"</p>

<p>It was Oleana and her husband Mr. Rose, with another man they didn't recognize following close behind.</p>

<p>At that moment, wind whipped through the trees as their helicopter came into view, its shadowy form outlined against the night sky. Oleana reacted quickly, tossing a Poké Ball onto the ground and sending Zacian out. "Zacian, Metal Claw!" she ordered.</p>

<p>"Suicune, Gust!" countered Kris. The wolf leapt at Suicune, its gleaming claws colliding with its opponent's side; Suicune, with an almost affronted roar, swung its head to bring forth a whirlwind hurling Zacian sideways. Zacian, itself a Pokémon of comparable power, skidded but held its ground.</p>

<p>The Team Rocket helicopter stopped overhead, dropping a rope ladder long enough for Archer to seize hold of it with one hand and the captive Mew with the other. Kris recalled Suicune to its Poké Ball and grabbed the ladder also as the helicopter began its ascent. Eevee clung tightly to her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Cut that ladder!" snapped Oleana, not about to give up. "Sacred Sword!"</p>

<p>"Eevee, Swift!" Kris called, and the small Pokémon attacked first, shooting bright shards of light at their enemies below. They sparked and flared as they struck the ground, disorienting everyone; in the impossible attempt to evade, Zacian missed its target, stumbling ungracefully over onto its side with a surprised yelp.</p>

<p>As the helicopter flew away, Mayor Cade – the man who had followed Rose and Oleana – asked, "You have a Mew here?"</p>

<p>"We <i>had</i> a Mew here," corrected Rose. "It was supposed to be Agate Town's secret."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Cade demanded.</p>

<p>"Why would we?" replied Rose straightforwardly. "You would have tried to catch it."</p>

<p>"Better in Cipher hands than Team Rocket's," countered Cade.</p>

<p>Rose thought about that and then sighed. "It pains me to say so, but in retrospect perhaps you're right."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm right," answered Cade. "Now Giovanni has a Mew. Do you think he'll be content? The only reason he has a fancy for powerful Pokémon is so he can use them to expand Team Rocket's territory. I wonder how long it'll take him to encroach on Orre, like he did Galar? My bet is...not long, if he's already sending spies."</p>

<p>Cade knew well how to win over Rose. He watched as his associate's indignation strengthened into resolve.</p>

<p>"Get some of our people together," said Rose darkly. "We're going to pay Team Rocket a visit."</p><hr />

<p>As the coastline of Johto came into view, Kris gazed out of the helicopter. Eevee pawed at the window, excited to be returning to their home territory.</p>

<p>Archer was in good spirits after the successful events at Agate Town. He glanced triumphantly from the captured Mew – which, in contrast to Archer, appeared to be in very low spirits – and then towards Kris with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Only your first mission, and we've bagged a Mew," Archer praised, "and thanks to your Eevee's Swift attack we were able to make a quick get-away. For a new recruit you show excellent promise. I can't imagine why I ever doubted bringing you into Team Rocket."</p>

<p>She smiled joyfully. "I'm excited to see what our hideout looks like. I know you've got one in the basement of the Mahogany Town grocery store, but I haven't actually seen it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right, you haven't been given a proper tour of our hideout yet," realized Archer. "As soon as we turn over the Mew to Dr. Colress, our chief scientist, I'll show you around."</p>

<p>The helicopter descended to land in the forest area around the Lake of Rage, and they walked back to Mahogany Town and slipped into the grocery store unnoticed by any of the townspeople.</p>

<p>They went straight to the laboratory, where they were met by Colress. "Good afternoon, Archer. Giovanni contacted me a half-hour ago and said you would be bringing a Mew to study." The look of fascination in the scientist's eyes at having such a unique test subject was impossible to conceal.</p>

<p>Archer handed him the captive Mew. "It's injured. You'll have to heal it."</p>

<p>"That will be easy to remedy," said Colress, looking over the Mew. "My, this poor creature looks so downcast. Was there really no other way to catch it?"</p>

<p>"The urgency of time made any alternate method impractical. ...Dr. Colress, meet Kris...she's one of our newest recruits," Archer changed the topic and introduced her. "Could you tell her a bit about what we're working on here?"</p>

<p>Colress readily and cheerily turned to his lecture. Getting him to discuss his scientific research, Archer had learnt relatively early on, was the surest way to redirect a conversation.</p>

<p>"Giovanni wants to learn more about neurological and genetic influences on Pokémon power, and in particular the effect of radio wavelengths on these factors," Colress explained. "Mew, as the genetic ancestor of all Pokémon, is said to be the most powerful creature of all. Perhaps by studying it we can learn more about the traits that increase statistical strength."</p>

<p>"That sounds very interesting," said Kris, with genuine inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>Archer had even more to say. "Giovanni thinks that by extracting and altering genetic samples, we might be able to create a Pokémon even more powerful than Mew itself."</p>

<p>"Alas, I doubt any effort towards bioengineering such a creature would bear fruit," dissuaded Colress, "but it might be worth the experiment just for Science."</p>

<p>At that moment, an alarm began blaring through the hideout. Archer snapped to attention as Kris looked around nervously. "Is that a fire alarm...?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Archer, his body tense, "it's an <i>intruder</i> alarm. Someone has broken into our hideout."</p>

<p><i>But it couldn't be an intruder, could it?</i> he wondered as he hurried to the security room with the monitors, and Kris following right behind him, <i>Who would be so brazen? Maybe one of the stupid cadets just tripped the alarm by accident.</i></p>

<p>When he saw the images on the monitors, he went into shock.</p>

<p>There had to be at least twenty men. They were dressed plainly, with their only distinctive similarity being the violet bandana they wore around their necks, which they pulled up to cover half their face so as to only show their eyes.</p>

<p>Accompanying them were several tough-looking Pokémon, which all looked as if they were at high levels.</p>

<p>On top of that, the men had guns.</p>

<p>Even worse, Archer noticed, the cadets and their Pokémon were faltering in the attempt to repel them. No one had fired a weapon yet, and the confrontation right now was an all-out Pokémon battle, but it would only be a matter of time. Cursing these unknown enemies, Archer raced in the direction of the conflict, seizing Houndoom's Poké Ball in one hand and the handle of his whip in the other. "You stay here," he ordered Kris.</p>

<p>"But I can help...!" Kris protested. "I have gym badges. I know how to fight."</p>

<p>"You might be good at Pokémon battles, but you have no combat training yet. These people don't look like they're going to respect the outcome of a Pokémon battle. They're paramilitary, as we are," he added grimly.</p>

<p>Archer set out to face the intruders, with Kris ignoring his admonition to stand back and following him at a distance.</p>

<p>No sooner did the battle begin, however, did Archer realize he may have grossly underestimated his Pokémon's stamina compared to that of his enemies. With Houndoom knocked out, and out of usable Pokémon, Archer found himself backed into a corner.</p>

<p>He pulled out the whip and held it taut, ready to fight them off himself, when Suicune leapt in between to face his assailants down.</p>

<p>Kris, who had been watching from afar, hurried over. "You okay Archer?"</p>

<p><i>Of course,</i> he recalled with succeeding elation, <i>we have a Suicune. We actually have a real Legendary Pokémon on Team Rocket's side! Why the hell am I so worried?</i></p>

<p>Suicune let out a roar as their enemies stepped back. They evidently had not expected to be confronted with such a powerful opponent. It was enough for Eevee to leap from behind, knocking the guns out of their hands with a spray of Swift shards before they could realize what had happened.</p>

<p>"Get 'em, Suicune!" cried Kris.</p>

<p>With another roar, Suicune unleashed its Aurora Beam. The icy ray struck the first of the enemy Pokémon headlong, and before the others could do much more than ready themselves to attack they were swept aside like Magikarp in rough seas. Suicune was too quick for them, and far too high a level. <i>I can see why the Pokédex says Suicune is called the reincarnation of the north winds,</i> considered Archer, watching the swift elegance with which the animal defeated its foes. <i>Thank God it's on our side.</i></p>

<p>Eevee meanwhile, was easily keeping the trainers away from their scattered weapons. None of these people seemed to know what to do when faced with fighting a Pokémon themselves. <i>That was one area, at least, where Team Rocket training had the upper hand,</i> considered Archer with pride. And with their Pokémon defeated, they ran for it.</p>

<p>"Go after them!" Archer commanded. "We've got to find out who sent them."</p>

<p>A small number of the minions raced after their fleeing enemies dutifully, accompanied by the growling Eevee evidently out for blood.</p>

<p>"You did great, Suicune!" Kris said cheerfully, petting her Pokémon. The Suicune gave a happy cry.</p>

<p>Archer gathered the remaining group of minions for an evaluation of injuries. Everyone was unharmed, but they <i>had</i> suffered losses, though not in the way any of them had ever expected.</p>

<p>"They took our Pokémon," said the cadet.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, they 'took' your Pokémon?" demanded Archer. "<i>We</i> take people's Pokémon, not the other way around."</p>

<p>"They just caught them off the battlefield as if they were wild," insisted the minion, wringing their hands. "I don't understand how their Poké Balls didn't detect our Pokémon as already having a trainer."</p>

<p>Archer narrowed his eyes, but his mind thought quickly to the conversation he had before with Giovanni, about the Silph Company and the modification of Poké Balls. Could it be someone else out there had the same idea? Only they were smart enough to act upon it? He tried to push the increasingly frustrating debate aside as the cadet continued lamenting:</p>

<p>"That was my Furret they took. I raised him from a Sentret."</p>

<p>"You can get another fucking ferret," retorted Archer, all while worrying about how his own Houndoom could have easily been snagged in the same fashion, and conveniently overlooking the hypocrisy of how they sometimes acquired Pokémon themselves. "What it sounds like is, these people got ahold of modified Poké Balls that allow them to catch anything. But we own every single Poké Ball manufacturer...except the Silph Company..."</p>

<p>"They must not have had many of those Poké Balls, if they didn't try it on Suicune," considered Kris.</p>

<p>"Legendary Pokémon are notoriously hard to catch. After all, they don't just walk up to you willingly," Archer added jokingly, "Frankly, unless they had a Master Ball they would have first had to subdue it, and that would have been a feat unto itself."</p>

<p>The idea they had stolen any of their Pokémon at all, however, had left Archer uneasy.</p>

<p>He left the minions to check on Colress' laboratory. He found the scientist amidst what looked like the aftermath of a tornado, his gear-like Pokémon Klinklang floating beside him as he gathered scattered documents and files into neat piles. Besides Klinklang, the flock of Porygon were also present, all of which looked determined – as determined as their blank stares could get, anyway.</p>

<p>"Dr. Colress, is everything all right here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We're quite well, Archer. My Pokémon and I were able to repel the intruders fairly swiftly," said Colress.</p>

<p>As Colress spoke, Archer looked around the laboratory, now in disarray. One thing stood out, and he froze. The cage where Mew had been was open.</p>

<p>"The Pokémon is gone!" exclaimed Archer, his eyes wide. "They stole our damn Mew!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't worry," Colress remarked, entirely at ease. "I released the Mew."</p>

<p>Archer just stared at him incredulously. "You released it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You <i>released</i> the Mew? Why would you think that's a good idea? That was a ludicrous idea!"</p>

<p>"The alternative was permitting our enemies to appropriate it," explained Colress. "We may not have Mew anymore, but neither do they...and better that it be loose on our territory than on theirs, where it would be harder to recapture it."</p>

<p>Archer thought about this, and saw the logic immediately. "Colress, I take it back. This is why you're considered a genius."</p>

<p>The scientist merely adjusted his eyeglasses with a smile.</p>

<p>"But Giovanni will no doubt be unhappy about what has happened," continued Archer, "I'm in shock that anyone would dare attack us. They must have a death wish." He then turned with accusation to the cadets. "Or they knew we were grossly unprepared!"</p>

<p>"They had really strong Pokémon," justified one meekly.</p>

<p>"At least we were able to fend them off," Archer said with disdain, "thanks to Kris and her Suicune. But if it hadn't been for that who knows what would have happened. Something entirely avoidable most likely, considering we're supposed to be top-notch Pokémon trainers."</p>

<p>"We do have another cause for concern, however," Colress spoke again. "They were able to confiscate several important documents pertaining to my experiments. Unfortunately, such a loss might put the research back several months."</p>

<p>"I had better get this information to Giovanni. See you later Colress."</p>

<p>The scientist waved Archer off and proceeded with the work before him. Archer and Kris walked quickly out the door and within minutes, crossed paths with the group of returning minions that Archer had sent out. They were empty handed, except for Eevee who had flat ears and was carrying a bandana.</p>

<p>"What happened?" he asked them.</p>

<p>"We lost them. Eevee was the only one fast enough to tackle one of them and take his bandana before he ran off with the others."</p>

<p>"That Eevee is a better warrior than the lot of you!" Archer snapped at them.</p>

<p>He bent down to get the bandana from Eevee and took a closer look at it. He recognized it immediately; it was from Orre.</p><hr />

<p>Archer was briefly called back to Team Rocket's headquarters after notifying Giovanni about the strike on their hideout.</p>

<p>He met the don in his office below the casino in Celadon City. The Persian lounged on Giovanni's lap, eying Archer with its usual circumspection as he dipped his head to his godfather.</p>

<p>Archer wasted no time in getting to the point.</p>

<p>"I need like five machine guns, a reasonable amount of ammunition, and a rose."</p>

<p>Giovanni stared at him for what seemed like a whole minute, the Persian on his lap purring with contentedly squinted eyes. Remembering his manners, Archer added by way of an afterthought, "...please."</p>

<p>"Archer, what is this about?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rose, the former Macro Cosmos CEO. I want to help him have an accident. With your permission, godfather," he added quickly.</p>

<p>"What did he do?" asked Giovanni.</p>

<p>"His men attacked our hideout."</p>

<p>"The reply to that, is to give a warning."</p>

<p>"Then they defeated our cadets."</p>

<p>"Then we beat him up."</p>

<p>"And me."</p>

<p>"...that makes me question why you were underlevelled. Haven't you been training against wild Pokémon?"</p>

<p>Archer narrowed his eyes. He <em>hadn't</em> been training as often as he should have; his own rancour at himself for such a failing was bad enough without his godfather scolding him for it. "They destroyed our radio antenna, not to mention stole documents with information on our research. Dr. Colress says without a way to broadcast, the scientific project has been set back greatly. Not to mention the escaped Mew, which has to be recaptured."</p>

<p>"Yes, we're probably going to have to kill him," conceded Giovanni. "He's a troublemaker."</p>

<p>"So can I have the machine guns?" Archer asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Archer, we're not common criminals. We don't go tearing through the streets like mob wars twenty years ago. Our business has rules."</p>

<p>
  <em>Rules. Again with the fucking rules.</em>
</p>

<p>"He didn't kill any of our people," Giovanni explained. "We should give him the opportunity first to recompense us for our losses. He owes us for the property damages, the Pokémon, and the aggravation. If he isn't reasonable..." And he gave a mild gesture.</p>

<p>His faith in Giovanni's leadership immediately restored, Archer straightened his posture. "And then?"</p>

<p>"I can send Jessie and James to handle that trifle if your group is still recovering," replied Giovanni.</p>

<p>Archer smiled slightly. "I think we'll recover much faster if we can settle our differences with Rose personally."</p>

<p>Giovanni sighed, "So many things to take into consideration." Persian looked up at him and squinted as he put his hand on the cat's head and smoothed his fur pensively. Now Giovanni was absolutely aware that Mr. Rose was becoming a formidable rival. "The only thing I see that can't be substituted for something of equal value are the research documents and the Mew, but if Mr. Rose is now as bold as he seems to have become, you will likely get your chance to settle his account."</p>

<p>"Godfather," Archer went on, "the Eevee that gave chase came back with this kerchief." He produced the purple neckerchief and added, "When Kris and I were teleported by the Unowns, we met with Mr. Rose and his wife Oleana. They invited us to their house briefly and I saw these bandanas around the necks of some of their guards."</p>

<p>"That concurs with the information Jessie and James got from Krieger," he continued, "He told them Mr. Rose was in control of a group known as Cipher."</p>

<p>Archer found himself thinking a little too hard about James and Jessie, and how lucky they were to be the boss' personal guards. They were always sent on the best missions in his opinion. Thinking about this, however, left a disagreeably sour taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>He really bore no ill will towards the couple; how could he? They had all been raised together, essentially as a family without blood ties, but to say he did not secretly harbor some unspoken envy towards them for being Giovanni's hand-picked bodyguards would have been a hopeless lie. He would have much rather been given that honor instead of dealing with the bunch of inefficient recruits back in Johto.</p>

<p>"...which only makes the situation ever more grievous." A frown crossed Giovanni's face, snapping Archer's attention back to the present. "You said they were able to capture many of our own Pokémon off the battlefield?"</p>

<p>"They had modified Poké Balls," Archer acknowledged. "Unless we have someone altering products from our own factories, those Poké Balls could only have come from the Silph Company."</p>

<p>"Come back tomorrow Archer, I will have a decision by then. ...and send Dr. Colress, I would like to have a word with him."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said Archer with determination.</p>

<p>Right then and there, he decided he had enough of inefficiency. If he wasn't good enough to be Giovanni's right-hand, it must be due to his own shortcomings, and the easiest way to measure that would be in how well he achieved his present tasks.</p>

<p>Giovanni wanted him to train their recruits, and he had failed. Fine; he could improve. He would see <em>them</em> improve. He was going to forcibly make them into proper Team Rocket agents, and in the process make himself worthy of Giovanni's praise...with a bit of good, old-fashioned discipline.</p>

<p>Shortly after Archer walked out of the office, Colress walked in.</p>

<p>"<em>Buongiorno</em> Colress," said Giovanni as he extended his hand, which the scientist shook in a friendly greeting.</p>

<p>Colress had also been requested to come to Team Rocket headquarters on account of what happened at Mahogany Town. He was always prompt and thorough in his explanations, and Giovanni was eager to hear an update from him as to how their project stood from the scientific standpoint.</p>

<p>"I have spent several hours trying to rewrite some of the research notes that were taken," Colress explained, adjusting his eyeglasses. "Although I commit most of it to memory, I like to rely on notes to ensure that no mistakes are made."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," replied Giovanni, "I will send some associates to fix whatever is needed. Give the admins a list of what is broken and whatever else you need to make your research easier, and I will review it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Delavita, notwithstanding that, I've completed my preliminary test," the scientist declared.</p>

<p>"And...?"</p>

<p>"Genetic modification has a negligible influence on Pokémon power."</p>

<p>Giovanni frowned, and Colress elaborated:</p>

<p>"It's more tied to their emotional and mental state. My analysis validates my previous, multiple observations on happy Pokémon...any strong emotional reaction, such as love for its trainer, has the potential to increase or decrease their power."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your report, Dr. Colress, though I must say the findings leave much to be desired," Giovanni replied. "How would you propose creating a strong emotional reaction in a Pokémon quickly?"</p>

<p>"A bond of friendship can't be fostered fast," admitted the scientist, "and emotions like rage and sadness are fickle. That said we also observed a paradox; a complete <em>lack</em> of emotion can produce a similar power increase."</p>

<p>"Explain that."</p>

<p>"Mostly we observed that when measuring the statistics of sleeping Pokémon. In the waking state most living creatures will have some trace of emotion, even if slight. Perhaps that is why, again, in my experimental studies I was able to produce a spike in power by placing Pokémon under hypnotic trance, and, other than emotional trauma I doubt there is another way to produce the same effect."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dr. Colress," Giovanni replied, "Keep me updated with regard to whatever new information you come across."</p>

<p>"Indeed," was the scientist's response.</p>

<p>"One other minor point..." added Giovanni, as an afterthought, "do you think the theft of these documents could provide Mr. Rose with any kind of advantage over us, either from a business or strategic standpoint?"</p>

<p>Colress analyzed the situation. "That quite depends if they have anyone there who understands them," he said finally. "I believe that Mr. Rose's wife, Oleana, once worked as a scientific researcher...?"</p><hr />

<p>Rose and Oleana were upset that their people had not recovered the Mew, but all annoyance dissipated as soon as they received word of having potentially acquired something else of value. They called Cade, requesting he meet them at their Agate Town residence to discuss this important turn of events, and he came by fairly quickly.</p>

<p>"It turns out Team Rocket has been working on secret scientific research," explained Rose, laying the stolen documents out on the coffee table.</p>

<p>"I don't see how that would pertain to us," Cade said practically.</p>

<p>"It might pertain a great deal to us, if we can find out what they were doing and use their discoveries against them."</p>

<p>"Or perhaps what they may have been on the verge of discovering," Oleana interjected, taking the documents from the table. "There's something they seem to have overlooked."</p>

<p>She examined the documents as she explained, her background as a researcher manifest:</p>

<p>"The radio signal they're using follows a pulse similar to the natural dyna-max radiation of the Galar region. Because of that, they're approaching it in the same manner, by haphazardly broadcasting the signal. The result tends to induce evolution in immature Pokémon. However if it were possible to target the central nervous system <em>directly</em>, it might essentially alter the DNA sequences that regulate what we commonly refer to as type..."</p>

<p>"Could you give me the concise version...?" requested Cade, who looked utterly lost.</p>

<p>"Team Rocket found a way to eliminate a Pokémon's natural weaknesses," Oleana said.</p>

<p>Rose looked proud of her revelation. Cade still looked confused.</p>

<p>"But they didn't even realize the extent of what they had in front of them," she added with marvel. "If my hypothesis is correct, this could lead to a scientific breakthrough in Pokémon neurophysiology."</p>

<p>Cade was apologetic but nonetheless relentlessly inquiring. "<em>I</em> don't realize what we have in front of us, with all due respect."</p>

<p>"We could make a water type immune to electric attacks," explained Oleana. "Or a fire type unaffected by water. It would probably increase their power overall too. Maybe even cause them to develop new attacks."</p>

<p>"What would be needed to do that?" asked Rose, who was already seeing the potential of a large army of practically undefeatable Pokémon.</p>

<p>Oleana thought for a long time. "If we irradiate one of the diamonds from the mine," she replied finally, "and then use that gemstone to power a kind of energy ray – not strong enough to cut, but strong enough so that the radiation can pass through bone tissue and reach the brain...it might work."</p>

<p>Rose turned to Cade with certainty.</p>

<p>"We're going to put people to work on this right away. The faster we can get ahead of Giovanni's men, the better. Cade, I know you've got plenty to do back at Phenac City, but do you think you'd have time to manage the project? I don't want to impose, but I need someone trustworthy to handle it."</p>

<p>His cajoling was hardly necessary. As soon as Cade had properly grasped the concept, he decided that he wanted to be involved.</p>

<p>He had his own plans, after all...and the idea of incredibly powerful Pokémon would be a spectacular help.</p>

<p>That morning, Giovanni arrived early at his office and kept busy as usual revising business documents and making phone calls. One of them was to Mr. Silph, who still refused to let his company be bought out.</p>

<p>Giovanni spoke bluntly. "I've overlooked several slights already. Your refusal to sell me a Master Ball, for one, even though I'm perfectly willing to pay the two-million price tag."</p>

<p>"Now Giovanni," began Silph, "you know the way they're made is a proprietory secret, and your people would just try to reverse engineer it. Right now Silph is the only Poké Ball manufacturer that can produce something with an infallible catch rate." And Giovanni had to concede the point, it would not do from a business standpoint to have one's only competitor acquire trade secrets, but neither did he let Silph go unscathed.</p>

<p>"You've been transporting contraband to the Orre region. You're letting Poké Balls out of the factory that lack the fail-safes required by law."</p>

<p>There was a noticeable pause. Giovanni could picture Silph squirming nervously, and it was an agreeable mental image till he spoke – sounding far more forceful and arrogant than Giovanni would have thought.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you're getting up in arms now just because a few Pokémon were snagged from you?" he scoffed.</p>

<p>"And how did you know we had Pokémon stolen from us?" asked Giovanni smoothly.</p>

<p>Once again Silph fell silent, but now it was with the unease of having been caught in a lie. By his own mouth he had laid bare his alliance with Cipher. Seeing as he'd been left at a loss for words, Giovanni went on:</p>

<p>"The Pokémon in question were, as you say, few. I can more than overlook it provided you recompense me for the damages my associates have endured as a result of your...shall we say, <i>defective</i> Poké Balls? Your majority stock in the Silph Company would be more than sufficient barter."</p>

<p>"Don't bother me with your business machinations, Giovanni." Without caring for a reply, Silph hung up the phone.</p>

<p>Such disrespect would not go unpunished.</p>

<p>Sometime around noon Giovanni glanced at his watch and frowned. "Unbelievable it's already midday," he spoke aloud to himself and glanced at his ever faithful Persian laying at his feet under the desk. "Time to take a lunch break," he added.</p>

<p>"<i>Mrreow</i>," responded the cat.</p>

<p>Giovanni pressed a button and almost immediately had an associate arrive at the office.</p>

<p>"I am going out to lunch...take any messages if anyone calls." He produced a Poké Ball out of his pocket and bringing the Persian into it, walked out of the office.</p>

<p>He arrived at the ground floor finding his limo and driver were waiting for him. "Federico's" he told his chauffeur.</p>

<p>They hurried there and he had lunch, alone. Giovanni did this often as it enabled him to be alone in his thoughts and analyze matters. Everyone at the restaurant knew not to disturb him while he was eating, even his personal guards would stay at a distance. Once finished, he motioned to the head waiter who tended to him.</p>

<p>As Giovanni left the establishment, he glanced up and down the street as a habit, and noticed a familiar person. His heart did a little jump as he saw Delia.</p>

<p>He kept looking at her hoping she would feel the silent stare and turn around in his direction; what a surprise he had when she did. Delia turned and looked straight at him...and smiled. He smiled back, which was a rarity to anyone who knew him personally.</p>

<p>She waved, and he did not miss the opportunity of raising his hand in greeting, "Wait a moment," he said to his driver, and walked over to her.</p>

<p>When they were face to face, Giovanni said, "Thank you for stopping for me. It means a lot to me."</p>

<p>"Thank you for helping me with the tax bill, Gio," she said.</p>

<p>He smiled but made no reply to this statement.</p>

<p>"Well, I have to get back home now," she broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Let me drop you off..." he offered.</p>

<p>"It's not very far, really," Delia replied.</p>

<p>"Please. I insist," he responded, "I notice you didn't bring your car, and the buses don't seem to be running on a regular schedule...that reminds me, I need to talk to the Mayor about this issue."</p>

<p>"Oh Gio," she smiled at him, "You haven't changed, much."</p>

<p>"Is that a good thing, or a bad thing?" he smiled back at her.</p>

<p>"A good thing," was her reply.</p>

<p>They were quiet for a moment and then she spoke up again.</p>

<p>"Alright, you may take me home."</p>

<p>"The car awaits us," he said motioning to his limo. The driver saw this and getting into the car, drove to where they were and held the door open for his boss and his companion to board it.</p>

<p>The chat in the car was minimal and the ride home was swift; once they arrived at Delia's house, she hugged him goodbye and exited the car.</p>

<p>When Giovanni returned to his office he asked his receptionist if there had been any calls, there had not, and then informed her that he was going home for the day. "Let's go home, Persian," he said aloud to the Poké Ball he carried.</p>

<p>Delia, meanwhile, was thinking of how her day had gone and a nostalgic smile crossed her lips.</p><hr />

<p>Bird Pokémon twittered happily as sunlight shone warmly across National Park, at walking distance from Goldenrod City. It kept its name from that historical age before the countries united into regions and formed a planetary council, and was the oldest and largest park in Johto.</p>

<p>The primary section of the park had wide pebbled paths and beautiful wood benches, running alongside flowering bushes and large stretches of grass where wild woodland Pokémon could occasionally be spied scampering about. In the very center was a picturesque fountain of white marble, with clean freshwater that caught the light as it poured.</p>

<p>Beyond these areas was a small forest, divided from the main path by a low wrought-iron fence. The forest trail, while technically part of the park, meandered into narrow hideaways and cliffside thickets that made it very out-of-the-way and a haven of solitude.</p>

<p>Archer had swiftly returned to Johto and gathered the cadets in one of these forested clearings. They were directed to kneel facing him in a line, which they did with some perplexity but without question. Only Kris was permitted to stand, towards the back at a small distance.</p>

<p>Archer evaluated the group, in one hand the whip that normally was coiled on his belt; beside him, Houndoom sat expectantly on its haunches. "You've been called here because you've all failed miserably," he began.</p>

<p>Curious glances passed between his audience as he continued speaking.</p>

<p>"Nothing can come between Team Rocket and perfection. We keep our reputation in glory and image because we're beyond a crime syndicate – we're an elite militia. I'm your teacher on Giovanni's personal request, not by my choice. I prefer dealing with experienced soldiers," added Archer. "The difference between experienced soldiers and you is that the former aren't blitheringly stupid. So perhaps all of you need a change in instruction..."</p>

<p>"Can I help?" Kris chimed in from the back.</p>

<p>"Kris, you stay out of this unless you want to join them," he snapped. She ducked her head down obediently.</p>

<p>He turned his attention back to the cadets, a couple of whom were trying to hide a snicker. <em>Adult brats,</em> Archer thought with annoyance. <em>They deserve what they're in for.</em></p>

<p>"We don't tolerate complacency. And we tolerate setbacks even less."</p>

<p>He pulled back with a vengeance. The whip slashed across their shoulders. The cadets flinched and grimaced; somebody couldn't hold back a strangled yelp. One of them jumped to his feet:</p>

<p>"Wait a sec—"</p>

<p>He could do little more than begin to talk before Archer now cracked the whip pointedly in the air. At the signal, his Houndoom sprang like a wolf, pinning down the rebellious recruit; the snarling dog's bared fangs and the heated breath of fomenting embers inches away from the man's throat.</p>

<p>Archer regarded the cadet with disgust. "They say the pain from a Houndoom's burn never goes away. Do you think that's true?"</p>

<p>Houndoom was growling. Archer could see the man's defiance falter instantly. "Forgive me...! Please...call off your Pokémon."</p>

<p>"I ought to give you five more lashes just for being a whimpering coward," Archer replied disdainfully. "Be thankful it's me punishing you and not Giovanni himself. He's reasonable, but not forgiving."</p>

<p>There was a stunned silence. Archer's audience had just realized he was not kidding. The whipping began anew, and without mercy. Anyone who squealed in pain, and there were a few, got three extra lashes. When it was over, Archer dismissed them and as they limped away, Kris walked to him and asked, "Is all this really necessary?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he simply replied as he coiled the whip and put it on his belt.</p>

<p>Archer and Kris wandered out of the forest to the main area of the park. They strolled along the path in relative silence, listening to the peaceful sound of songbirds and leaves.</p>

<p>The first of them to speak was Kris, when she put her hand in her jacket pocket, suddenly stopped and said, "Oh, no. I think I forgot my identification card back at headquarters."</p>

<p>"What?!" Archer exclaimed. "How in hell could that happen? It's supposed to be kept by your bedside along with the clothing you're wearing the following day!"</p>

<p>Kris had a sheepish look on her face, "Hold on, maybe it's hidden away in one of my other pockets." She fumbled as she searched her pockets and retrieved different objects from them; some Poké Balls, berries, and a wallet, and as she got hold of the wallet it fell out of her hands and several cards and papers that were within scattered on the ground.</p>

<p>"It's a miracle you've gotten this far on your own," Archer scoffed as he helped her gather everything up. He saw a photograph amidst the documents and as he picked it up he froze in shock.</p>

<p>The photo was of a woman sitting under a tree with two children; a boy and a girl. The girl was a very small child, almost an infant, and the boy was approximately nine years old.</p>

<p>Archer looked at Kris steadily without saying anything. Kris noticed it. "Is something wrong Archer?"</p>

<p>"This image..." his voice trailed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Kris explained, "Oh, that's a picture of me and my mom and brother... before she died. You see I'm an orphan but the people who took me into their home were kind enough to save this picture for me. I carry it everywhere."</p>

<p>"Kris," he asked, "Where is your brother now?"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew. We were separated when my mother died and were split up between two different families. I was taken in by my mother's relatives and he by our father's... I was just a baby and as you can see by the picture he was a small boy so we didn't have much control of anything, really... I never heard of him again." Her face was sad and she took the picture from his hand and stared at it.</p>

<p>"Let me show you something," he said as he pulled out his own wallet from his pocket, and showed her a duplicate copy of the photograph.</p>

<p>Kris opened her eyes wide as she saw the photo, then looked up at him and asked, "Why do you have a copy of my picture?"</p>

<p>Archer's gazed softened as he looked at her face and searched for the right words to say, finally replying, "Because I am the little boy in the picture. That is my mother too...and my baby sister."</p>

<p>Kris' eyes filled with tears, and quietly flowed down her cheeks. He took her by her shoulders and drawing her near, embraced her for a long time. "You are my sister. My sister," he repeated incredulously. "I thought about you often but as a small child my options were limited in getting anyone to help me find you. When I grew up, I didn't know where you had been taken to."</p>

<p>They parted, and she just looked at him in silence, finally speaking she said, "I can't believe it. All this time..." her words cut off at this point from emotion.</p>

<p>Archer spoke up, "Everything is okay now, sis. I'm returning to Celadon City tomorrow morning, and I will tell Giovanni; he is my godfather. I think he will welcome you with open arms... after all, dad was a Team Rocket member and Giovanni likes to keep families together if possible."</p><hr />

<p>From vibrant Goldenrod City, Archer and Kris took the train to Celadon City in Kanto. It was little more than two hour's-long travel from one region to the other via rail, and the scenery was a bonus. As they proceeded swiftly along the tracks, Kris glanced out at the forest landscapes that flitted past; once or twice she saw a Sawsbuck lift its head to watch the passing train with curiosity, its antlers bedecked by leaves as autumnal orange as those of the trees.</p>

<p>"I was so small when I was taken to Johto, I don't even remember Kanto," she admitted, turning from the train window back towards her brother.</p>

<p>"I'll have to show you around when we get time," he said. "Many of its cities are larger and more developed than Johto's. Just wait till you see the Silph Company skyscraper; it's even taller than the Goldenrod radio tower."</p>

<p>"Have you lived there all your life?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though I travel a lot because of my duties in Team Rocket. Give it some time; you'll see plenty of the world too. I'm going to ask Giovanni if I can handle your training myself."</p>

<p>Kris brightened up. "That'd be great!"</p>

<p>"Of course. I just found my little sister. I want to get to know her better. Damn it, we have all these years we have to catch up on." Archer tipped his head slightly. "You never did tell me why you were so desperate to get into the syndicate either."</p>

<p>"I'd heard a rumor that my father had been part of Team Rocket," Kris revealed, "and that my brother had been the ward of someone who still was. I figured joining was the best chance I had to find out what happened to my family. I didn't expect I'd find you so quickly! But I have no idea why we ever ended up being separated."</p>

<p>"From what I understand," Archer elaborated, "Giovanni was chosen as my godfather but mom picked someone else for you. As such, he had no claim to take you in when we were both left orphaned. Back then was when Team Rocket first began. It was when the Delavitas were at war with another family. Our father was <i>consigliere</i> when he was killed in a hit from our enemies, when mom was still pregnant with you. It's easy to forget how vicious the Kanto and Johto regions were back then, given how peaceful they are now...till the civil war in Unova happened, that was considered the most violent time in modern history. Mom wanted to distance herself and us from the violence, but she wasn't able to move out of the region before our enemies attacked her. They didn't respect the idea of 'civilians' who were kept apart from the business...in their eyes, <i>anyone</i> affiliated with the Delavitas was to be taken out. Giovanni always says there are rules, but they sure as hell didn't follow them."</p>

<p>"Who's <i>consigliere</i> now?"</p>

<p>"Giovanni's pet Persian."</p>

<p>Maybe he couldn't keep the splinter of envy from his tone, his private rancour at Giovanni's having granted one of their organization's most coveted positions to an animal, because Kris regarded him pensively before asking point-blank:</p>

<p>"Are you hoping to one day inherit Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>Her remark surprised him. "Oh? Does it seem that way?"</p>

<p>"Not really," replied Kris with honesty. "But it does seem you aspire to more."</p>

<p>He thought about her words, but then briskly shook his head. "All I really want is to be of service to Team Rocket. We can't afford any kind of selfish thinking. Giovanni knows what's best for Team Rocket, and upholding the glory of our syndicate is what matters."</p>

<p>He glanced out the window as the train pulled in to a small town platform in order to let off a few passengers. It was only there for a short period before swiftly setting off on its way anew. "The next stop is where we get off, at Celadon City," Archer said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile James, Jessie, and Meowth were strolling along the Celadon City sidewalk towards the train station, enjoying both the cool fall breeze and each others' company.</p>

<p>As the trio walked along, James embraced Jessie. "I think you get more beautiful with every day that passes."</p>

<p>She remembered distinctly how they had come to be partners. Essentially raised in Team Rocket, they'd always had a rapport beyond that of friendly coworkers and more of soulmates. Giovanni could see for himself how well they worked together.</p>

<p>James had always been the mild-mannered one of the duo. They were effectively dating before their relationship was official, neither admitting what was evident to the whole world. She remembered when he finally confessed his love for her, one perfectly moonlit night on a rooftop.</p>

<p>"You had to muster up the courage," she teased.</p>

<p>"No that wasn't it," James replied with a smile. "I was waiting for the right moment to tell you. It had to be special."</p>

<p>"Sentimental," Jessie smiled back, leaning over and kissing him.</p>

<p>Meowth twitched an ear but did not join the conversation, instead leaping ahead happily to spring upon one of the fallen leaves and trap it under his fore-paws; practised hunting skill in the harmless form of play. When he spied a wild Rattata gnawing on a berry, however, and the rodent sighted him and accordingly darted away into the underbrush, Meowth's eyes widened with excitement and he immediately abandoned the leaf on the hunt for real prey.</p>

<p>Jessie placed her arms akimbo. "Meowth, what the fuck."</p>

<p>"Be right back," the cat purred, and he escaped into the bracken with a swish of his tail.</p>

<p>"He refuses to touch kibble, only eats human food, yet goes after a Rattata like we're in a famine," Jessie said, shaking her head. "Who can understand that cat?"</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a small, crying sound from the parked cars along the sidewalk. Jessie and James bent down to find the cause peering out from under a truck.</p>

<p>It was a small kittenish creature, with pink fur and large blue eyes. It had a thin tail nearly as long as its body, and dainty little paws like those of an ermine.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing under that truck?" asked Jessie sweetly. "Come out."</p>

<p>It stared back with wide eyes, the fright of injured innocence.</p>

<p>"Oh come on, we're not going to hurt you," Jessie assured. "Did someone hurt you? We'll beat them up."</p>

<p>This seemed to coax the kitten out, and Jessie picked it up gingerly. "Look at that – it is hurt."</p>

<p>James rummaged through his pockets. "I know we have an extra potion somewhere..."</p>

<p>Sure enough he produced the flask of medicine, which they sprayed on the kitten's injuries; the wounds, which looked like burns from something, faded away before their eyes.</p>

<p>The little animal now happily, and surprisingly, levitated out of Jessie's arms with a series of squeaky mews.</p>

<p>"Where's Meowth when you need him to translate?" Jessie said, perplexed.</p>

<p>"What kind of animal is that anyway?" James wondered.</p>

<p>"Who knows," answered Jessie, "Must be a flying type if it can float like that."</p>

<p>Circling the couple once, the kitten flew off to the berry bushes beside the path.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Meowth returned to where James and Jessie were, minus rodent. "I'm back. What've we got?"</p>

<p>"We found that kitten under the truck," James told him. As he spoke the strange Pokémon flew back over, presenting the two humans with a berry it had picked.</p>

<p>Meowth gave a surprised meow. "I've never seen a flying cat before."</p>

<p>"Most people have never seen a <em>talking</em> cat before," countered Jessie.</p>

<p>The kitten gave a few happy mews, which Meowth translated, "It says it wants to thank you for helping it out."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>The kitten did not answer. Instead, it blithely produced a large bubble of energy in mid-air and began bouncing playfully on it.</p>

<p>"Well," considered Jessie, "we ought to call it something."</p>

<p>Jessie picked it up and the three of them stared at it.</p>

<p>"<em>Mew</em>," the little animal squeaked.</p>

<p>James spoke first, with decided certainty. "Paulie."</p>

<p>"Paulie?" Jessie echoed.</p>

<p>"He looks like a Paulie," James said.</p>

<p>"He could be a she," pointed out Jessie.</p>

<p>James shrugged this off. "If she's a girl she's Polly, and if he's a Paulie he's Paulie."</p>

<p>"What?" questioned Meowth.</p>

<p>"Polly," Jessie smiled, "would you like to be one of my Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"I named it," James protested, "I should be the one to catch it."</p>

<p>"Hush up. You can't tell if it's a boy or a girl."</p>

<p>The kitten gave a few mews. Meowth translated:</p>

<p>"It says it likes both of you but its species are free spirits and it wants to stay free."</p>

<p>"That's unfortunate," said James.</p>

<p>"Also...it's a she."</p>

<p>"Called it," said Jessie. James snapped his fingers, "Polly, then" he said.</p>

<p>They watched the little Pokémon zip away into the bracken.</p>

<p>As the three of them approached the Celadon City train station and halted here, James remarked, "Jessie, when was the last time we took a vacation?"</p>

<p>"We had that assignment in Hoenn," she replied.</p>

<p>"A real vacation," said James. "We could revisit Hoenn for the sake of it...spend time lounging along the seashore and sunshine..."</p>

<p>Jessie's eyes brightened with enthusiasm at the thought. "Wonderful idea, James! It'd definitely beat Kanto's snowy season. It's autumn now," she considered, "maybe when winter comes we could ask the boss for a brief leave."</p>

<p>Meowth once more chimed in as the voice of reason amidst their frivolity. "You know every time you guys do that, we get double the work piled on us when we come back right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, who cares? I think it's a great plan," declared Jessie, "Don't you feel like taking a few days off?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I could use some time to catch up with Meowzie and the kittens," Meowth purred, his mind now captivated by personal thoughts of feline romance and family.</p>

<p>The train pulled into the stop, and Archer and Kris disembarked to be met by James, Jessie, and Meowth.</p>

<p>"Well, look who's here," said Jessie, "the newest brother and sister duo."</p>

<p>"You should give her a mini tour, Archer," James added, "Giovanni's meeting isn't for another two hours."</p>

<p>"I might do that," Archer replied, "but we should get something to eat first."</p>

<p>"Is this the elite pair that work as Giovanni's personal guard?" Kris asked with a wide-eyed look.</p>

<p>"Oh right. You never met them," Archer said, turning to introduce his colleagues. "Kris, meet James, Jessie, and the ever chatty Meowth... Guys, this is my sister...Kris."</p>

<p>"Fate works in a mysterious way, it seems," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Nice ta meet'cha," Meowth spoke up quickly, "happy ta hear that you two found each other."</p>

<p>Kris' eyes widened. "Wow! I've never seen a Pokémon that talks!"</p>

<p>"You talk to Eevee," dismissed Archer.</p>

<p>"We can communicate all right, but Eevee doesn't speak human language," Kris pointed out.</p>

<p>"I'm special," purred Meowth proudly.</p>

<p>"Archer, we were headed to the mall for lunch..." James addressed him, "why don't we all go."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Jessie, "you can point out some sights along the way."</p>

<p>"Ok, sounds good," Archer replied, "I'll bring out my Houndoom; he could use some exercise by walking."</p>

<p>"...and I'll bring out Eevee," added Kris as she took her Poké Ball from her backpack.</p>

<p>"Houndoom, emerge!" shouted Archer.</p>

<p>"Eevee, out!" Kris joined in.</p>

<p>Houndoom appeared wagging its tail, and gave a contented bark when Archer patted it on the head. Eevee squeaked happily and immediately hopped onto Kris' shoulder.</p>

<p>The group of friends walked up the street together chatting animatedly. Archer and his sister Kris, James and his girlfriend Jessie, Meowth, Eevee, and Houndoom; enjoying the peace that comes with true fraternal unity.</p>

<p>"So what's all that about an attack on Mahogany Town?" James inquired. "Giovanni was irate about it."</p>

<p>"Don't even remind me of it," scowled Archer, "it was a bunch of goons sent by Cipher. They made us lose a rare Pokémon we'd made off with, not to mention some kind of research paperwork. It's a disastrous blow to our syndicate's image."</p>

<p>"<i>Ffftt</i>. That's no cat-astrophe," Meowth chimed in with a yowl and a lash of his tail, "So a Pokémon gets away; you guys can recapture it, no sweat. And paperwork? What can they do with that?"</p>

<p>Little else was said regarding rival syndicates and lost possessions. The sentiments expressed by Meowth were shared by most everyone there; even Archer, who thought that Cipher was an annoyance, yet certainly not one that should ever come to matter in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Rocket Game Corner was objectively far too flamboyant for a secret lair, but considering Team Rocket's natural flamboyance such an in-your-face hideout worked perfectly. It was Giovanni's flagship casino, a glitzy public playground with the undercurrent of subtly sinister charm. It stood only a block away from an elegant office building that was the official business headquarters of Rocket Enterprises, but the center of their illicit activity was without doubt the casino.</p>

<p>Glittering violet neon and rich red carpeting complemented each other in an almost magnetic dalliance. Slot machines were a bright enticement, which drew the onlooker into its shimmering maze-like siren song, and wide tables where games of roulette, craps, and baccarat beckoned further with their temptation of wins and losses. Everywhere people in elegant attire milled about, either testing their fortunes or watching the games, and sparingly in the crowd one could find a Pokémon accompanying its owner as a disinterested sentinel. To the far side of the floor was a long bar with a glass counter, displaying an entire wall of fine liquor behind the bartender, and on the opposite side was a reception area to collect one's winnings; chips could be cashed out for money or rare Pokémon.</p>

<p>All this was the show put on for prying eyes. No one took heed of the back of the casino floor, where a switch, hidden behind a poster on the wall, granted access to the expansive basement level and Team Rocket's headquarters.</p>

<p>Giovanni's office was spacious with furnishings of fine leather and mahogany and, hung on the wall behind his desk, a tapestry bearing a single red R. Jessie, James, and Meowth entered to find Giovanni on the telephone. His Persian sat beside him, angling one ear to them as they stepped in but not giving them much more than a second thought.</p>

<p>"Mr. Silph, I've been very nice till now," Giovanni was saying. "I don't think you want this whole matter to turn impolite."</p>

<p>On the other line, Silph's reply was astoundingly haughty, "Word around is that you're going to retire soon anyway. I don't put too much credence in Team Rocket being the all-powerful empire it was twenty years back."</p>

<p>"What would give you that idea?" asked Giovanni calmly.</p>

<p>"I know people. People you've made enemies of, who are stronger than you. Yes," he added, almost relishing the point, "there's actually someone stronger than the Delavitas nowadays."</p>

<p>"You're indebted to Team Rocket," Giovanni pointed out, starting to sound annoyed. "Remember Mr. Silph...You don't take from us without giving something in return. That is only fair."</p>

<p>Silph spoke defiantly. "You don't scare me, Giovanni."</p>

<p>"I will," Giovanni replied, with sinister brevity, and hung up the phone.</p>

<p>He then turned his attention to his two elite agents standing before him. Jessie gave a dip of her head.</p>

<p>"You sent for us, sir," she said.</p>

<p>"I want to know what you've been able to find out about Silph and any secret, under-the-table sort of deal he's made with Rose."</p>

<p>"Well, sir..." James said, "frankly...nothing."</p>

<p> The Persian gave a slight growl, and Giovanni shook his head with displeasure.</p>

<p>"He has to be getting something in exchange for those modified Poké Balls," Giovanni scowled. "As if our problems with the Mew weren't enough."
</p>

<p>"Mew?"</p>

<p>Giovanni hesitated. "...yes, I never briefed you on that. Mew is said to be the rarest, most powerful Pokémon of all. We had one in our grasp, but that damned attack on our Mahogany base allowed it to get away from us. From what we've heard it's since travelled from the Johto region into Kanto, but its aimlessly lost and untraceable. We can't do anything about Mew until we figure out where exactly it is."</p>

<p>He stroked Persian pensively. The cat flexed its claws as Giovanni glanced back at James, Jessie, and Meowth.</p>

<p>"I'm temporarily assigning the two of you to guard headquarters here till I figure something out regarding the Silph Company."</p><hr />

<p>This work was quiet, and although it was not so busy, that only bred boredom in people such as Jessie and James.</p>

<p>Jessie was sitting atop a small tabletop and licking a lollipop in a way that could only be described as lascivious, every so often glancing sideways to her partner with mischief.</p>

<p>James had become enraptured watching her and could neither give in to his corporal needs nor did he want her to stop, however, he knew the sorts of flippant remarks that would result if others in the organization saw her.</p>

<p>"Stop that," James said finally, with a little smile.</p>

<p>"Why?" Jessie asked coquettishly.</p>

<p>"You know why," he teased back.</p>

<p>"Maybe I don't," she replied as she met his smile with her own, knowing very well, "Why don't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Why're you people always horny as fuck?" meowed the cat, scratching behind an ear with a hind paw.</p>

<p>"Stay out of this Meowth," they both answered in unison.</p>

<p>Before the conversation could be followed any further, Archer and Kris passed by. Their entrance spoiled the mood considerably.</p>

<p>"Where are you heading?" asked Jessie, throwing out the lollipop.</p>

<p>"Orre," Archer replied, "We've got a special mission to find and kill the bastards making life difficult for Giovanni. I'm taking Kris with me to learn the ropes."</p>

<p>"We're going to be incognito!" added Kris cheerily.</p>

<p>"The boss said no uniforms this time," explained Archer, "we don't want to make a scene yet."</p>

<p>"If you're undercover that means you're also not taking the Suicune," observed James, "or else they'll be able to pinpoint where you're from fast."</p>

<p>"We've got my Houndoom, remember?" Archer countered. "We'll be fine. Anyway it's thanks to your intel we've got a starting point in the Orre region and Kris and I were able to corroborate it."</p>

<p>"Yeah, we had to put that traitor Krieger through the third degree to make him talk," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"How come you two always get the fun assignments?" Archer prodded.</p>

<p>James eyed him a little cagily. "Sometimes I question your concept of fun, Archer."</p>

<p>"Incidentally, I heard you two lost a fight afterwards?" Archer asked, "Are you guys alright?...it must've been a hell of a wild Pokémon."</p>

<p>"That damn twerp," Jessie muttered, then answered him, "It was a trainer...he used a Pikachu."</p>

<p>"Oh shit," Archer replied, "Sorry I asked."</p>

<p>Jessie shrugged her shoulders. "Forget it," she said, "It happens to everyone."</p>

<p>"Yep," agreed Archer, "but...I'd keep an eye out for him, and get my revenge at some point."</p>

<p>Kris chimed in. "That might be easier said than done, though."</p>

<p>"Come on Kris," her brother grabbed her arm and guided her away, "Bye guys, see you later."</p>

<p>As Archer and Kris headed on their way,  Jessie turned to James and said, "Isn't it incredible how fate works? He was trying to shake her off as a naïve candidate for Team Rocket, only to discover she's his long lost sister."</p>

<p>"Honestly, Jess..." James confessed, "If I hadn't seen it happen myself, I might not have believed it possible."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," Jessie changed the subject, "I can't believe with our kind of training we got beaten by that twerp...twice in a row now!"</p>

<p>"With a little bit of luck," answered James, "he's off gallivanting to the next Pokémon gym, which will kick his ass so bad he'll give up, go home, and get a job like the rest of them, leaving us to do our work in peace."</p><hr />

<p>"The next Pokémon gym is here in Celadon City!" said Ash excitedly, as Pikachu gave a cheerful squeak.</p>

<p>They had attempted yet again to enter Saffron City, but this time instead of a Rocket minion, they encountered a Snorlax. The huge Pokémon had planted itself right in front of the opposing gate entrance to the town and had fallen asleep after eating its meal. Ash had figured they would just go on to Celadon and return to Saffron at another time, so they detoured yet again via the pedestrian underpass.</p>

<p>He was content though, because Celadon was considered an exciting city that was truly alive at night, with an array of nightclubs and hotels that glittered like jewels under neon starlight. The most famous was the casino, which stood as the centerpiece of that shimmering crown.</p>

<p>Having arrived in mid-morning, he decided to eat breakfast. As they ate, he eagerly discussed the next gym battle.</p>

<p>"The Celadon gym leader is a woman named Erika," he was telling Pikachu, "She's a specialist in grass types, so fire types are supposed to be best against her." Ash was quick to dismiss this. "But you can hold your own against any opponent...right Pikachu?"</p>

<p>Pikachu chattered a response in between bites of its meal. Ash smiled broadly at what it said, which remained intelligible to everyone there but him.</p>

<p>"Though hopefully we won't meet up with those people from Team Rocket again," commented Ash, getting a bit too emboldened as he added, "They're pushovers but the way they show up everywhere, they're kind of annoying."</p>

<p>"<i>Pika</i>!" the little animal squeaked affirmatively.</p>

<p>A waiter who was serving nearby, overheard the conversation and finally wandered over apologetically. "Please don't consider me presumptuous, but...are you a traveller?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ash.</p>

<p>"You really shouldn't talk so loud about Team Rocket. Not in Celadon, anyway."</p>

<p>"Why is that?"</p>

<p>"They have a lot of power here," was all he said, then feeling somewhat emboldened, leant over to them.</p>

<p>"Keep this quiet," he whispered, "but I've heard the casino is owned by Team Rocket."</p><hr />

<p>With a name like Rocket Game Corner, it could not have belonged to anyone <i>but </i>Team Rocket.</p>

<p>Perhaps he ought to have kept away from the casino, considering he had already had two run-ins with the mob – and high-ranking mobsters at that – but Ash was extremely curious about what the waiter had said about Team Rocket, and curiosity made him careless.</p>

<p>After challenging the Celadon gym and winning the badge on the first try, he justified going here to himself as a celebration instead of just his own inquisitiveness. It was easy to become enraptured by the glistening lights and luxury of this place, so much so that Ash did not notice when Pikachu snuck off.</p>

<p>"Where's Pikachu?" he realized, looking around for his missing pet.</p>

<p>Ash began searching for his Pokémon. A quick survey of the floor shortly revealed its whereabouts. Off in an inconspicuous corner of the casino wall was a big picture of a rocket, flying up into outer space. Pikachu was poking at something behind it; as it seemed, he had found a small switch that opened a hidden door on the wall. It betrayed a narrow stairway leading down to a basement level. There was a <i>click</i> as the switch was pressed; Pikachu gave a happy squeak, and before Ash could stop it the little animal ducked into the stairway.</p>

<p><i>Oh shit,</i> he thought, rushing after him.</p>

<p>Ash tentatively descended the steps to find himself in a more sedate, office-like labyrinth of corridors. The floor here was green-and-white tile, with wide well-lit corridors intermittently lined with potted palms. The place looked desolate.</p>

<p>Pikachu was standing alertly in the center of the hall, ears lifted and fascinated with this new place to explore. Ash cringed at how utterly unconcerned his pet was.</p>

<p>"Come on Pikachu," he protested, "we shouldn't be in here."</p>

<p>Pikachu gave a noncommittal chirp.</p>

<p>He came over and picked it up, to which the little creature let out a few sparks and a growl of annoyance but allowed Ash to place it on his shoulder. "Let's get out of here," Ash said, and was turning around to head back when his way was suddenly barred by a group of five guards.</p>

<p>They were part of Team Rocket, no doubt about that. They wore the recognizable black outfits with the red R and Coppola caps and whips, and they had already sent out their Pokémon in readiness for a fight.</p>

<p>"How did you get in here?" one of them demanded.</p>

<p>"It was a wrong turn. We're leaving," Ash assured.</p>

<p>"A very wrong turn," sneered another, "Grimer – Sludge Bomb!"</p>

<p>Pikachu parried their attacks and in an array of electric arcs quickly defeated all five enemy Pokémon. Ash watched bemusedly as the low-rank Team Rocket guards tensed with concern.</p>

<p>"Pikachu beat you guys. We'd like to go now," said Ash, looking hopefully beyond them to the way back upstairs.</p>

<p>"You think we're through with you just because our Pokémon lost a battle?" answered one of the guards, pulling out a dagger.</p>

<p>Pikachu let out another shock, striking his hand; the Team Rocket minion yelped as the knife fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Ash called to Pikachu, and as his pet jumped to his shoulder he ran in the opposite direction. At this point he could hear shouts for backup, footsteps in pursuit, sounds of new Poké Balls opening to unleash more animals to the attack.</p>

<p>They narrowly evaded their pursuers round a corner and finally lost them by ducking into one of the side rooms.</p>

<p>Steadying his breath, Ash allowed himself to explore his surroundings. It was a fairly nondescript office, all decorated in the same pale green of outside and with a wide wood table in the center. There was also a Poké Ball.</p>

<p>Ash went over and examined the locked capsule on the table. It didn't feel empty, but the most telltale sign it contained an animal inside was the small inscription that should have borne the owner's serial number, which had been neatly removed.</p>

<p>"This must be a stolen Pokémon," Ash realized.</p>

<p>If Team Rocket were stealing Pokémon away from trainers and mistreating them besides, he would be doing this one a favor by stealing it back. Maybe he could find its true owner along the way. It would certainly be better than leaving it here.</p>

<p>Pocketing the capsule, he proceeded back down the hall only to end up face-to-face with Jessie, James, and Meowth. Ash's heart plummeted.</p>

<p>"It's payback time, you twerp," said Jessie, unfurling her whip.</p>

<p>"You'll regret humiliating us at Mount Moon and Lavender Town," assured James.</p>

<p>They were going to kill him, weren't they? They were the ruthless Team Rocket, renowned for their civilized savagery of blood and roses. Yet what surged within him was defiance, mingling amongst the nascent sparks of something colder. If he would not leave here alive anyway, then he would fight to the end.</p>

<p>"Get 'em Pikachu!" Ash called.</p>

<p>Pikachu sprang to attack with an electric flare; Arbok and Weezing and Meowth met the assault head-on, and a fight ensued.</p>

<p>This time the Team Rocket party seemed more prepared and held their ground steadfastly in weaving offensive. When Ash uncertainly looked away from Pikachu faltering on the battlefield he could see Jessie and James watching him with amused interest, as if they were patiently toying with prey.</p>

<p>"When the Pokémon falls, the trainer is next," said James ominously.</p>

<p>Ash's thoughts were a turmoil. He was used to sporting matches, where the stakes were never life and death. His heartbeat pounded as quick as the fight's tempo; they were once more forcing a triple battle when all he had with him was Pikachu. He began cursing his own self-assurance that sent him onward from gym to gym with his only animal, instead of lingering in the wilderness to catch a full team of six. If he only had more Pokémon...</p>

<p>Then he recalled the Poké Ball he took from the table.</p>

<p>It was folly, Ash would think in retrospect, to believe a stolen Pokémon would listen to anyone immediately. Nonetheless, he tossed the Poké Ball out to the battlefield, and the blaze of light formed into an imposing creature.</p>

<p>It was the same Charizard from Cerulean City, except healed to full strength. It beat its wings and let out a fearsome roar. Excited realization bred hopefulness and Ash had to stop himself from cheering at what he had unleashed.</p>

<p>"All right Charizard," exclaimed Ash, now as motivated as ever, "help Pikachu!"</p>

<p>Contrary to Ash's directive, Charizard flew up into the air and aimed its Fire Blast attack directly at James and Jessie.</p>

<p>Both Team Rocket agents leapt away with practised expertise, yet Charizard bore down upon them vengefully. Right as the dragon was about to assail them again Ash called out:</p>

<p>"Charizard <i>stop</i>!"</p>

<p>To his surprise the Pokémon responded to him. It landed on the ground but kept growling, its wings spread threateningly and its eyes locked on Jessie and James. Ash hurriedly recalled it to the Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"...oops," he muttered with a wince.</p>

<p>The trio glared at Ash, and suddenly, a smile crossed the faces of James and Jessie. The battle was immediately cut short and the Team Rocket agents stood at attention as Meowth scampered over to his human companions and poised similarly on his hind paws.</p>

<p>Sensing a presence behind him, Ash turned to see the boss of Team Rocket, Giovanni Delavita, standing in the shadows.</p>

<p>He had watched the whole thing. At Giovanni's heels, the shining eyes of Persian glinted menacingly as he stepped forward into the light.</p>

<p>"I must say I'm impressed you got this far." He was terse, but not impolite, and he dismissed Jessie and James with a small signal. When they dipped their heads and left obediently, Giovanni turned back to the young trainer before him.</p>

<p>"Well, Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town, what brings you to my private office?"</p>

<p>"You know my name?"</p>

<p>"I know everything about you."</p>

<p>"Then, shouldn't I have the courtesy of knowing who <i>I'm</i> talking to?"</p>

<p>"My name is Giovanni Delavita. I am the leader of Team Rocket."</p>

<p>Ash felt himself blanch, at least he thought he had; outwardly he was as composed as ever. But if he had felt there was some slim hope of flight, he was now entirely convinced he would die here.</p>

<p>"I've heard you've been interfering in our business," Giovanni said, betraying no ire. "I even heard you picked up a Marowak before my employees could retrieve it."</p>

<p>"Your employees almost killed it," replied Ash. "Now it's mourning its lost cub."</p>

<p>"You mean this Cubone?" He stepped over to his desk, opened a drawer, and retrieved a locked Poké Ball. "One of several such acquired assets from our Lavender Town operations."</p>

<p>"Assets?" To Ash the word sounded improper applied to living creatures.</p>

<p>"It's not even weaned, and it would be far more costly to care for it till it is. You may take it if you wish. But the Charizard belongs to us," he added, sternness edging his tone.</p>

<p>Ash accepted the Poké Ball from Giovanni, and reluctantly returned that of Charizard, but somehow he felt there had to be a trick brewing behind such unexpected geniality. "You said it was several 'assets'," he ventured. "What will become of those Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"Whatever is most profitable for us."</p>

<p>"They're innocent parties."</p>

<p>Giovanni's thoughtful look returned, but he spoke evenly:</p>

<p>"You're idealistic, and little more than a child. You pity these Pokémon. Team Rocket traffics in the thousands, with similarly poignant tales. This...in conjunction with many other business exploits, pervading vice to politics. If I were to philosophise over the rightness or wrongness of what Team Rocket does, we would not profit."</p>

<p>"That's all that matters? Profit?" Ash demanded.</p>

<p>"To maximise our profit while minimising our losses, yes. When it comes to business, there's no room for things like friendship."</p>

<p>Ash said nothing, entirely in disagreement and feeling he'd already said too much. Yet Giovanni had far more to say:</p>

<p>"...years ago, Kanto had one of those gilded eras when the world shone so brightly it was easy to be dazzled. There was no such organization as Team Rocket. There was only the Delavita family and the Cadáin family. This was when the region had a prohibition on gambling. We ran gambling operations behind our nightclubs; so did the Cadáins, who ran a competing enterprise out of the north. Our family kept to the south, and for a long time there was peaceful distance.</p>

<p>"One day Mr. Cadáin decided he wanted to expand his operations, and in so doing tried to force a merger. The ambush killed not only my father but my mother, who had never been involved in any of this to begin with."</p>

<p>Giovanni's voice remained composed with cold fire.</p>

<p>"That left me in charge of the family business, with a debt to collect. If the Cadáins wanted a small-scale war, they would get one: a <i>real</i> war, against a uniformed army of both men and animals with military training. If they wanted our gilded world set aflame, I vowed to set the match myself. By the end of that week only Team Rocket remained. I collected Mr. Cadáin's payment...personally."</p>

<p>Recounting the memory had left Giovanni subdued. He pushed away the thought as if it had been a stressful daydream.</p>

<p>"Flames dazzle just as much as gold."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. "I'm surprised you would tell me such a personal history," Ash admitted.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised a fledgling trainer could get past my elite guards." Giovanni's brown eyes turned harsh. "If you insolently attempt to interfere with Team Rocket again, you will feel a world of pain."</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers at the Persian, which reacted instantly; electricity gleamed on its whiskers, and it let loose a Thunder attack that fell directly on Pikachu. The little Pokémon let out a cry.</p>

<p>Persian was powerful; even with its use of a move that was Pikachu's own type, it had caused damage. "Pikachu!" Ash exclaimed.</p>

<p>Pikachu was stunned, but not knocked out. It countered without command, with its own Thunder attack, and Persian let out a screech and fainted.</p>

<p>Astounded, Giovanni watched wordlessly. Pikachu was lower level than Persian. How could it have defeated the cat?</p>

<p>As Ash scooped up the injured but still battle-ready Pikachu into his arms, Giovanni pointed briefly to Pikachu.</p>

<p>"That's a powerful Pokémon," he said simply. "Take care you don't lose it."</p>

<p>And with a cordial gesture, Giovanni bid him farewell.</p>

<p>For a brief moment, Ash hesitated, unable to believe the don of the most dangerous crime syndicate in the world would simply let him go. Even as he walked out of the headquarters, out of the casino, all the way back to the Pokémon Center; he waited silently like one condemned for the executioner, for a shot or stab of pain to wash into darkness, yet it never came.</p>

<p>The sky, of course, held special significance to Team Rocket if only by virtue of symbolism; however, it was easy to lose oneself in the romanticism, especially those times they took the hot-air balloon out.</p>

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth all loved the view from up here, even if they only rarely commented upon it. One could see to distant mountains along the curving horizon and the Johto region beyond, while below the trees became green carpet and the buildings were small squares and pyramids. All around was openness and a sense of peace; the heaven's azure expanse faded faraway into cream, dotted only with the gentle drift of white clouds – and that was merely at the low heights.</p>

<p>Team Rocket had helicopters for quick getaways, but the hot-air balloons were for espionage plain and simple. They floated along innocuously, could go as high or low as needed without drawing unwanted attention from the noise of rotors, and if someone actually did have the gall to question their presence they could easily say they were out for leisure.</p>

<p>Not even Giovanni knew who they were spying on today, however. They wanted to surprise him.</p>

<p>Below, they could see Ash in the midst of a Pokémon battle against another trainer – his rival, Gary Oak. None of them paid heed of the balloon drifting serenely at a fair distance.</p>

<p>Pikachu appeared to be holding its ground against a Squirtle in the match. It was a water type; Pikachu's electric attacks should have had the advantage, but it was on the defensive in a haphazard attempt to evade the turtle's blasts of water. There seemed to be very little technique, reflected Jessie, in how Ash commanded Pikachu.</p>

<p>After a while of this sparring, Gary recalled his Pokémon. "Squirtle, come back."</p>

<p>"Throwing in the towel, Blue?" Ash asked.</p>

<p>"I want to give all of my Pokémon battling experience," Gary replied easily, unlocking another Poké Ball.</p>

<p>Ash crossed his arms haughtily. "Oh, you're so sure you're going to win?"</p>

<p>Gary laughed. "I always win against you, Red!"</p>

<p>Ash grimaced.</p>

<p>Watching the battle play out from the hot-air balloon floating above, Jessie lowered her binoculars and turned to the others.</p>

<p>"The Pikachu is powerful. The trainer is average," she asserted.</p>

<p>"So you figure the reason we lost before was a fluke?" James questioned.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt," Jessie smiled.</p>

<p>James smiled back. "Then stealing that Pikachu from him should be child's play."</p>

<p>"Are we sure about this?" Meowth posed. "We don't even know who this guy is."</p>

<p>"Who cares <i>who</i> he is," James waved off the matter, "if he's against Team Rocket, he's fair game."</p>

<p>"Besides," added Jessie, "I want to get back at that damn twerp for fucking with us not once but thrice."</p>

<p>Meowth responded with an ornery <i>ffftt</i> but said nothing further.</p>

<p>They noticed after a while that the fire keeping their balloon aloft was dying. Leaving the battle behind, they headed back to headquarters when suddenly a fierce gust of wind blew them off-course in a tumult, and before any of the trio knew what had happened they crashed.</p>

<p>They had landed somewhere in a wildwood grove. To one side was a spring, with a small waterfall cascading down a rock face. Giant, ancient trees provided a canopy of shade; with some tree branches torn down from the balloon's crash, sunlight filtered down to the forest floor to bestow a heavenly shimmer on the water as it pooled below into a crystalline pond before meandering off in the form of a mountain creek. Wildflowers bloomed in abundance here, so vibrant and so colorful it was surprising they could exist in such obscurity. Meanwhile dense underbrush skirted the clearing to create a cosy thicket.</p>

<p>It was beautiful, but entirely isolated. Jessie surveyed their surroundings and then scowled. "We're at fucking Mt. Silver."</p>

<p>James had glanced at his transceiver. "No wonder there's no phone service. God, I remember trudging through these woods when we were all training for elite rank. It's like fighting through the fucking rainforests of Hoenn."</p>

<p>"Just our luck. Out in the damn jungle again." She groaned with exasperation. "Well, let's get going back to civilization; the Indigo Plateau is where...due north?"</p>

<p>Meowth tried to follow, but with a growl he collapsed, and he ended up on all fours lifting one hind paw with pain.</p>

<p>"Meowth, you all right?" Jessie glanced back at him.</p>

<p>Meowth clenched his teeth. "I hurt my paw."</p>

<p>"I got a Full Restore somewhere..." James began to say searching his pocket, only for Meowth to interrupt.</p>

<p>"I think I broke it," the cat growled. "Those spray medicines won't do any good."</p>

<p>"Meowth, why'd you have to go and break your paw?" Jessie teased.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah, really funny. Why'd you have to go and crash the fucking balloon?" Meowth hissed back.</p>

<p>James tried to soothe their discord. "Jessie, Meowth, we shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves this way."</p>

<p>"You thought of a better way?" hissed Meowth, his ears flat with pain.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a mew, and they all turned to see a familiar creature watching them bicker. It squeaked in good-natured laughter and gave a little somersault as it floated in midair.</p>

<p>Somehow just noticing the little animal had the effect of immediately dissipating the squabble. "Hey, it's Polly!" James exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Do you live here?" asked Jessie.</p>

<p>Polly gave a cheerfully affirmative mew and floated by a crevice near the waterfall, where a soft den had been made of moss and flower petals.</p>

<p>Meowth crouched where the crash-landing had torn up the ground. He flinched when Polly came over and poked his leg gently.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm hurt. Go away somewhere," said Meowth with a little hiss.</p>

<p>With an echoing mew, Polly unleashed a wave of energy to wash over Meowth where he lay. The cream-furred cat tensed with a slight mew of pain, and then opened his eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>He stood tentatively, first on all fours, then on two.</p>

<p>"My paw is...better," remarked Meowth, "It's healed!"</p>

<p>Polly mewed happily and flew in little circles around him.</p>

<p>Jessie bent down to the ground. Where the soil and plants had been hopelessly uprooted from the landing, now before her eyes the grass regenerated, to be tipped by wildflowers extending renewed petals to the sun. "James, look at this. Even the <i>plants </i>healed."</p>

<p>"Wow," murmured James, in fair awe.</p>

<p>The kitten meanwhile flew over to the rim of the basket and examined the balloon, which was deflated but not damaged. Opening its mouth, it sent forth a stream of fire to reinflate it. The trio all gazed at this with wonderment.</p>

<p>"Was...that an Ember attack?" James realized. "And it used Heal Pulse before."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of Heal Pulse being that powerful," Meowth commented.</p>

<p>Jessie tallied everything up. "It flies like a bird, but can heal better than a Chansey. It likes the water, yet it uses fire attacks."</p>

<p>They all looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p>"It's a grass type," decided Meowth.</p>

<p>"What the..." James started to say.</p>

<p>"No wait, hear me out," purred the cat.</p>

<p>"Yes, Meowth," Jessie said, crossing her arms, "we're waiting."</p>

<p>James' eyes widened. "Do you mean to say, you think we've discovered a <i>new species</i> of Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"The missing number of the Pokédex," purred Meowth.</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous," Jessie objected.</p>

<p>"Are there any more of you guys?" James asked the kitten, "Maybe one of your friends might want to come with us."</p>

<p>Polly gave a few little mews and Meowth translated.</p>

<p>"It says they aren't many of them, and in any case it repeats that its kind are free spirits and like to be free."</p>

<p>"Too bad," sighed James.</p>

<p>The kitten retreated into its den. Jessie eyed James and Meowth a bit disdainfully. "Missing number of the Pokédex. Now I've heard everything. Well, we've got our balloon back, and your paw is healed; let's set off."</p>

<p>As they drifted away from the forest, Jessie noticed James deep in thought. "All right James...out with it. What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Jessie," he began, "do we even know what Mew looks like?"</p>

<p>"Umm..." Jessie considered the question. "Well, no. I imagine it must look like something powerful. It's supposed to be an extremely powerful animal, isn't it?"</p>

<p>James was a bit tentative. "You don't think Polly is what the boss is looking for...?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, that couldn't be..." And her voice trailed away.</p>

<p>The idea of the playful little kitten, who they had befriended, being Giovanni's prize... It would live only to fight, kept caged when not in its Poké Ball. This, for a creature so committed to liberty. Subtle murmurs within Team Rocket's high ranks spoke, too, of how Mew could be exploited as a laboratory subject in Giovanni's secretive genetic project, a cold investment into creating an invincible beast.</p>

<p>For all Jessie, James, and Meowth did routinely in this business, somehow these thoughts alone made them ill.</p>

<p>Meowth gave a yowl. "According to legend, Mew appears only to those people who are pure of heart."</p>

<p>They thought about this for a moment, and then they all had a good laugh and went on to a different conversation. There was no way in hell it could be a Mew.</p><hr />

<p>During all that time, Mr. and Mrs. Rose's experiment with the stolen Team Rocket research proceeded flawlessly. Cade personally oversaw the so-called Shadow Project and the Pokémon that would be their test specimens.</p>

<p>It was called the Shadow Project because of the irradiated diamond they used as a power source. The gemstone turned so dark-purple under the influence of the concentrated radio waves that it became a nearly solid black. They referred to it as a shadow crystal.</p>

<p>The apparatus for their experiments was developed swiftly, and the animals were gathered even faster. Some were Pokémon that Cipher had stolen from the cadets at Team Rocket's hideout in the Johto region. Others had been stolen from random trainers around Orre, and yet more had been snatched from the wild in the Unova region, which lay on Orre's northernmost border, and from the Hoenn region, which was not too far to the south.</p>

<p>Exactly as Oleana had anticipated, the energy ray altered the Pokémon nervous system enough to negate their type. But Cade, thinking of what would further his own hidden ambitions, wanted to achieve not just a physiological change but a psychological one. He set out with this intent in mind, accepting no less than his objective. The entire process therefore comprised of multiple steps.</p>

<p>He had an apt starting point in the after-effects of the laser, which had a disorienting effect on the creatures. Within the course of a weeks' merciless re-training of such 'processed' Pokémon he succeeded in eliciting total obedience from them. It helped that most defaulted quickly to relying on whomever fed them as their new trainer.</p>

<p>Sometime around the height of that week Gary Oak returned to the Orre region. He sought out Cade at the Phenac City Hall, and the mayor invited him in.</p>

<p>The mayor's office was wide but not extravagant. An oaken desk lay to one side, and a glass bookcase stood behind the desk bearing tomes about the history of the Orre region. There was also a patterned brown rug that graced the floor's sandstone tiles, as well as a television set opposite this; the air here was fresh and still bore an almost new scent from a recent remodeling.</p>

<p>"Have you trapped any Legendary Pokémon?" Cade asked, straight to the point as if he already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"It wasn't easy," replied Gary, "they kept fleeing on sight. I had to use a Jigglypuff to sing them to sleep before I could even toss a Poké Ball at them."</p>

<p>Cade nodded briskly. "There's a reason why they're considered such valuable prizes."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I was only able to catch two of them... Raikou and Entei. Some other trainer caught Suicune before I could do anything about it," grumbled Gary.</p>

<p>"I'd heard something of the matter," answered Cade, who accordingly didn't seem too surprised. "I've been keeping a close eye on things."</p>

<p>Gary said nothing to that as he placed the Poké Balls containing Raikou and Entei on Cade's desk. "You said you'd have something worthwhile to trade me for them?"</p>

<p>"I did," Cade affirmed, "and I do."</p>

<p>"Great. What've you got?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you in on a little secret," smiled Cade. "Here in Orre my associates are working on a secret project. We're fine-tuning a process that can eliminate all weakness from a Pokémon."</p>

<p>Gary's eyes lit up with intrigue, and Cade's smile only grew wider.</p>

<p>"We call them Shadow Pokémon," added Cade, "They're highly obedient and extremely powerful. Of course if the League finds out a single one of your Pokémon are out of the ordinary you'd probably be disqualified, because the battle would be rigged to your benefit. However, if you want a surefire way to win, you'll have to throw <i>honest</i> out the window."</p>

<p>"I doubt anything we're doing is entirely honest," Gary admitted, to which Cade laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>"For two Legendary Pokémon, I can offer you two Shadow Pokémon," offered Cade. "Old-fashioned power for modern power..."</p>

<p>"How do I know whether they're really as powerful as you say they are?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you see for yourself? I'll pit one of our Shadow Pokémon against your team in a battle."</p>

<p>They stepped out to the sunlit courtyard. A mild breeze brought cool water-spray off Phenac's crystalline streams, and shifted the fronds of the palm trees just enough for them to rustle softly. Distant clouds foretold of rain.</p>

<p>Gary flung a Poké Ball to the ground, and it opened in a dazzling white gleam. "Squirtle, come out!"</p>

<p>The turtle Pokémon emerged with a cry.</p>

<p>Cade in turn, retrieved a Poké Ball from the pocket of his suit jacket and opened it with a press of a button. When Gary saw the ferret Pokémon, he frowned.</p>

<p>"A run-of-the-mill Furret, huh?" he said.</p>

<p>"This Furret is not run-of-the-mill <i>anymore</i>, by any means," said Cade.</p>

<p>As Gary stared at the Pokémon, he could see there was indeed something different about this Furret. It carried itself with a complete emotionlessness he had never witnessed in any other Pokémon, even among those trained up to the highest levels, and it glanced at Cade merely awaiting its orders; not with faith in its human, or begrudging acceptance of its owner, but with a sort of nondescript compliance. There was no sign of personality.</p>

<p>"All right," said Gary, steeling himself, "let's see how it can do. Squirtle, use Water Gun!"</p>

<p>Cade did little more than make a swift motion with his hand, not even a verbal command, and the Furret sprang at Squirtle violently. Squirtle struck out with the force of its water attacks, but its enemy shook them off as if they did no damage at all before easily tackling the turtle Pokémon onto its back.</p>

<p>Squirtle now flailed in a piteously futile effort to right itself. At another hand signal by Cade, the Furret returned to its ready post before him, its features entirely impassive.</p>

<p>Gary wasn't about to lose. "Squirtle, return. You're up next...!" he declared, throwing another Poké Ball onto the battlefield.</p>

<p>One by one, his team of six trained Pokémon fell to Cade's Furret. Little by little, Gary became enraptured by the idea of having such an incredibly fierce and disciplined Pokémon of his own.</p>

<p>"You've impressed me," Gary said, when he had lost the match. "How did you ever come up with these...what did you call them? Shadow Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"I told you, the process is a secret," Cade replied, recalling the Furret.</p>

<p>"Mayor Cade, I'd like a whole team of your Shadow Pokémon," continued Gary. "If I'm going to be a little dishonest to get ahead, I may as well be a complete liar and take the lead."</p>

<p>"Two Legendary Pokémon, two Shadow Pokémon," Cade reiterated. "You've already seen how strong these creatures are. I'm not willing to relinquish them for anything other than an exceptionally rare animal."</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything else you'd trade for?"</p>

<p>"Depends. What do you have to offer for your side of the bargain?"</p>

<p>"What would you be interested in, besides rare Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"Well," began Cade, pensively, "I don't know how much you get around. But a travelling trainer no doubt meets many people during the course of his journey, and hears many things."</p>

<p>"Yeah, lots of things," Gary corroborated.</p>

<p>"You have no doubt heard about Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"Everybody in the Kanto region has heard about Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"Well, if you could find out something for me about the people who manage the syndicate...not the low-rank people, mind you," Cade clarified. "I'm interested in the <i>elite</i> agents, their admins."</p>

<p>"What kind of info are you after?" asked Gary, gingerly trying to determine his motives. "The stuff Team Rocket is working on?"</p>

<p>"The truth is I want to know more personal information, about their private lives. People they talk with, people they're close to. Friends and family and lovers..."</p>

<p>"Salacious things?" Gary ventured.</p>

<p>Cade gave an almost modest smile. "Let's say, things that they'd like to keep discreetly to themselves."</p>

<p>"I can do a lot better for you than their admins," grinned Gary.</p>

<p>Cade raised an eyebrow, prompting Gary to go on.</p>

<p>"The Team Rocket don had a fling almost twenty years back with a woman in Pallet Town called Delia Ketchum. She's kind of a friend of our family."</p>

<p>"Do they still see each other?" Cade asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I know he leaves her flowers," Gary replied, "but I don't know if they've actually seen each other in person in a long time. From what I heard through the grapevine, Giovanni has other relationships but to this day he still pines over Delia. I know way more than <i>this</i> too, because I once eavesdropped on my grandfather chatting with her. He caught me listening and made me promise not to tell Red. So, of course...I'm not telling <i>Red</i>..."</p>

<p>"Red?"</p>

<p>"Delia's kid, my rival Red – well, Ash, but everyone in Pallet Town calls him Red."</p>

<p>Gary visibly relished being purveyor of Pallet Town's deepest secrets. When he saw Cade lean forward with interest like if utterly immersed in a radio drama, he revealed the biggest secret he knew yet:</p>

<p>"Ash is Giovanni's illegitimate son."</p>

<p>Archer had never been a saint.</p>

<p>Whereas Jessie and James took such actions as murder and torture as necessary evils inherent in their line of work, when the situation arose he often took it as a matter of sport. Bearing an almost macabre curiosity that played with the sense of pity, Archer could be one of the most sadistic of Team Rocket's elites, provided Giovanni's orders permitted it.</p>

<p>Now the hunter had an apprentice.</p>

<p>Kris, far from the immature cadets he'd previously been assigned, already showed herself to take the matter with more attentiveness. She seemed aware, too, that it behooved her to learn as much as she could – because when hunting the most dangerous game, there was always the chance that the advantage might shift and the prey turn on its pursuer. She showed no hesitation or judgment, rather approaching their assignment with willing studiousness.</p>

<p>He screwed the silencer on the handgun, his motions as experienced with the action as they were attentive to detail.</p>

<p>"I presume you have no experience with any liquidation of assets," said Archer, echoing the euphemism Kris had used prior.</p>

<p>"None at all," she replied openly.</p>

<p>"You'll watch how I handle it, then. Don't interfere."</p>

<p>Off to the side, Eevee and Houndoom were playing with each other, batting a bullet back and forth as if it were a toy. The two animals had evidently become fast friends since Kris joined Team Rocket, and if Archer was teaching Kris everything she needed to be a Team Rocket agent, Houndoom had apparently taken it upon itself to train Eevee in the finer points of being an agent's main Pokémon. Their playful pouncing and chasing was a test in agility.</p>

<p>Kris narrowed her eyes. "Wouldn't this have been easier with Suicune?" she asked Archer.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I don't think many humans would be able to take a head-on attack from a legendary Pokémon."</p>

<p>"You need to be able to work even without the back-up of a legendary. Team Rocket established a reputation of being effective and feared on their own merit. There's a reason why the average grunt just uses a Rattata or a Zubat. We always like to have more, however we don't <i>need</i> any more."</p>

<p>Kris could not deny that.</p>

<p>Archer motioned to her to follow, and the Pokémon tagged after them at their heels as they stepped out of the motel and receded into the moonlit night.</p>

<p>They had learnt who commanded the Cipher squadron sent to attack their hideout. His name was Merardi, just Merardi, no one was sure if it was a first name or a last and he kept that bit of information well hidden. In the grand scheme of things it made no difference; their mission was clear. They would send a cold-blooded message to Cipher not to mess with Team Rocket, and then they would go a little further by finding out where Cipher was based.</p>

<p>It was easy to trail Merardi. He had an unfailing evening routine, where he would walk to the local colosseum, spend two hours there betting on the battles, and walk back home. He was so predictable it astonished Archer for carelessness. However, it only went to show Cipher was far less astute compared to Team Rocket. Archer always liked any validation of Team Rocket's supremacy.</p>

<p>Archer and Kris walked in the silence until they spied their target. Merardi was strolling down an empty street ahead; suddenly, almost as if he sensed someone else around, he stopped and turned to look around. Archer and Kris quickly hid behind a tree close to the sidewalk and kept quiet till Merardi resumed walking at a brisk pace. He ducked into an alley.</p>

<p><i>He's got enough common sense to switch up his trail when he's being followed,</i> thought Archer, as he and Kris hurried after him.</p>

<p>The Team Rocket agents saw a shadowy figure leaning against the wall of one of the buildings, approximately four yards length away. Archer put out his arm and stopped Kris from walking any farther in, and at that point the shadow spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh...it's you...took you long enough to figure out who you were dealing with."</p>

<p>Archer's demeanor kept a cold cordiality. "Merardi, Team Rocket does things on their own timing."</p>

<p>"You know my name...that's fast work. Somehow I didn't expect it from a band of petty-ante bandits who can get their hideout invaded so easily."</p>

<p>"Where is Cipher based?" Archer asked, disregarding his comment.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is something your boss wants to know, isn't it?" Merardi teased, "Unfortunately for you I am under strict orders to not disclose that information."</p>

<p>Merardi moved quickly to retrieve a Poké Ball from his jacket, but Archer's Houndoom acted faster. Houndoom sprang at him, knocking the Poké Ball out of his hand before he could unlock it. The locked sphere hit the asphalt without releasing the Pokémon and rolled out of reach. Merardi, now flustered, tried to leap for it but Houndoom barred his way, snarling menacingly as Archer swiftly pulled out the gun with a silencer and aimed directly at the man.</p>

<p>"We know there's a shipment of Poké Balls arriving from Silph. Where will they be received?" Archer insisted.</p>

<p>"As we speak, that shipment has already arrived in Orre and will be taken to the old mining warehouse on the edge of Pyrite Town," snapped Merardi, though he now kept his hands raised disarmingly. "I have no qualms about telling you that because everyone knows Team Rocket has no jurisdiction in that territory...Cipher rules it."</p>

<p>"For now," was Archer's simple answer.</p>

<p>Merardi tipped his head back and laughed. "Are you serious?" he chuckled. "Anyway our base is so far-removed from civilization you'll be racing against the clock to ever find it before our leader gets his revenge."</p>

<p>Kris watched everything wordlessly. She saw Merardi's defiant challenge, and then the dark frost of malice that glittered in Archer's eyes.</p>

<p>"Times up for you, anyway," said Archer as he pulled the trigger. Two shots rang out, hitting Merardi once in the chest and once in the neck, causing him to slump to the ground.</p>

<p>At that point, Archer walked slowly over with Kris following close behind till they got near enough to make sure their target was dead; meanwhile Houndoom padded over, holding the Poké Ball in its jaws, as Archer threw a rose to the body. Archer then glanced over and took the sphere from the dog, handing it to Kris.</p>

<p>"That is how we take care of business. We eliminate anyone who gets in the way of Team Rocket," Archer explained nonchalantly, adding, "The Pokémon are always useful. They go back to headquarters."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said; they left the area quickly and Kris asked no questions and made no comments. She was a fast learner.</p><hr />

<p>Pyrite Town had a less than stellar reputation. Carved into a rocky canyon, its dingy, rusted buildings set along faded asphalt gave it a sinister look and most people avoided going there, except for those that had connections that were considered illegal.</p>

<p>"There's a reason why Pyrite's known as the town of earth, wind, and money," remarked Archer to his sister. "You can always turn a profit here."</p>

<p>They were lingering nonchalantly beside an abandoned warehouse off on a side road from the main street. A faded sign on an adjoining wire fence bore the designation: 'Pyrite Mining: Main Access Building'</p>

<p>"Back in the mining heyday of Pyrite Town, they would occasionally unearth evolution stones and sell them cheaply," Archer went on. "When was your Eevee supposed to evolve, anyway?"</p>

<p>Kris looked at Eevee, which squeaked.</p>

<p>"Eevee says any day now, but they're still trying to decide if they'd rather be an Espeon or an Umbreon."</p>

<p>"I can't believe you're leaving that up to your Pokémon," he said disapprovingly.</p>

<p>Kris didn't dispute the point but she didn't make any concessions either. "What're we standing around here for, Archer?"</p>

<p>"You know how they got those Poké Balls that work on caught Pokémon? What I asked that Cipher stalwart about, rest in peace?" Archer added in a flippant way, and she nodded vigorously, "From what a contact of Team Rocket's says, the Silph Co. shipment is supposed to be coming in here around noon. We're going to see who gets it and follow them."</p>

<p>"Straight to Cipher's hideout?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea. See, you're learning fast, Kris. Way faster than the rest of those dumb recruits."</p>

<p>As he spoke, they noticed an unmarked truck pull into the driveway, and as Archer and Kris pulled back so as not to be seen, they saw some men who were evidently from Cipher and a few strong-looking Pokémon come out to meet the driver.</p>

<p>Crates bearing the Silph Company logo were loaded off the truck and taken into the warehouse.</p>

<p>Archer hadn't expected that; he'd expected the shipment to be driven elsewhere. He and Kris gingerly snuck into the warehouse and watched as the crates were placed on a very old cargo elevator and descended somewhere.</p>

<p>"They took it to the Under," Archer muttered, "why am I not surprised?"</p>

<p>"The Under?" Kris questioned.</p>

<p>"If Pyrite Town doesn't hide its unsavory side, it looks respectable compared to the subterranean level," Archer explained, with appropriate satisfaction. "It's a whole community located literally underground. Everybody who does business there, like us, simply call it 'The Under'...in Orre it's always been the hub of black market Pokémon trafficking."</p><hr />

<p>Practically everyone in the Under had at least one animal walking with them; so that in the event of a fight, they wouldn't be ambushed before even being able to call out their Pokémon. That made the already-bustling underground city appear extra crowded.</p>

<p>Gaudy neon in violet and cyan hues blended with harshly buzzing fluorescent lights to create a peculiar aesthetic of vice and beguilement. The ceiling was easily miles overhead, creating a vast grey cavern within which the covert township flourished, and in the kind of trade that could only be found in such a place as the Under, merchants openly advertised and sold all manner of illegal goods.</p>

<p>None of that was new to Archer, who had been to the Under before. What was new was how frequently they spied people with the signature violet bandanas.</p>

<p>"Cipher's gotten a stronghold on the place since I was last here," he mused.</p>

<p>Eevee seemed to like the Under. Its ears had lifted alertly and it was looking around with interest when suddenly it let out a cry and pawed at the air.</p>

<p>Following Eevee's direction, they quickly located the Cipher guards with the crates and saw them go into an area marked 'Private'.</p>

<p>"There they go!" Kris said.</p>

<p>Pursuing briskly but at a distance, Archer and Kris soon found themselves on a platform not unlike that where one might board a subway train. Neither the men nor the crates were anywhere.</p>

<p>"An old rail line," Archer remarked. "I didn't know that was down here."</p>

<p>"They must've gone down the tracks," Kris considered.</p>

<p>Archer and Kris walked along the tunnel, keeping close to the wall and away from the tracks, till the murky pathway opened out and they reached another platform. Here a flight of wide steps ran upward with a faint glow of light somewhere at the top.</p>

<p>They emerged from the steps to a small storage room, with white-painted walls and an almost sterile coldness in the atmosphere from central air conditioning set much too high. The lights here, contrary to the semidarkness of the Under and its secret passageways, were blazingly bright.</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are?" Kris asked, looking very lost.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Archer admitted. He could see there were two exit points here, one leading further into the place and the other leading outside. He gingerly opened the latter to see where they were.</p>

<p>The building was white and windowless, a harshly modern bastion in the middle of the forsaken desert. The property was surrounded by a laser fence, with a single gate controlled by an electronic lock. As they watched, a small caravan led by a black limousine Archer recognized as Mr. Rose's drove up to the gate, and he and Kris ducked back so as not to be seen when Rose and Oleana passed by.</p>

<p>They could hear murmurs of greeting as Rose and Oleana were met at the foyer, and ushered along accompanied by a man who appeared well-acquainted with them. Archer vaguely recognized seeing him at Agate Town, when he had been alongside Rose and Oleana in the Relic Forest as an observer, but he did not know his name.</p>

<p>Motioning to Kris, Archer decided to go after them. They stepped lightly as they followed them down the hallway. It seemed the place was some kind of a laboratory.</p>

<p>They soon reached a larger room where they found the Silph Company crates stacked one atop the other, and hid behind the boxes alongside miscellaneous items that ran the gamut between bags of Pokémon kibble and a lone shovel. One of the crates had been opened to present its cargo of shining new Poké Balls. <i>The infamous, illegally modified Poké Balls</i>, thought Archer, <i>which they used to steal from us. Silph is going to be in deep shit.</i></p>

<p>That validation wasn't nearly as interesting, however, when Archer and Kris caught a glimpse of what were opposite the crates.</p>

<p>Dozens of Pokémon in cages were lined up, as if on display for Rose and Oleana to inspect. There were several Cipher henchmen with their distinctive purple neckerchiefs here guarding the cages, and quite a few of their own animals sitting around as fellow guards. One of these, a lupine Pokémon known as a Mightyena, kept sniffing the air and whimpering as if it detected some scent out of the ordinary but couldn't place it.</p>

<p>Rose was making comments about some sort of quota Cipher wished to meet, and Oleana was silent but observing the caged Pokémon almost warily.</p>

<p>Archer was still wondering about the other person presenting the creatures, but from the way he acted towards them Archer deduced him to be a business associate of Rose's; not entirely a subordinate, but not necessarily above him.</p>

<p>Kris voiced his thoughts. "Who's that guy with them?"</p>

<p>Archer studied him. "I don't know."</p>

<p>Mayor Cade was showing off the caged animals to Rose and Oleana, grinning from ear to ear. "Not bad, isn't it? Out of the batch of Pokémon, fifty endured the processing with no ill effects."</p>

<p>"Only fifty? How can that be?" Oleana remarked surprised.</p>

<p>"Some of them couldn't take the pain. They went into shock."</p>

<p>"You haven't been anaesthesizing them?"</p>

<p>"Oh." He lingered on the response uncertainly. "Were we supposed to?"</p>

<p>Words could not express the look of fury on Oleana's face. Cade shrank back involuntarily as Rose held her shoulders soothingly. "Now it's not the end of the world, my dear Oleana," said Rose, "considering all of the other oversights that could have been made."</p>

<p>"There shouldn't have been an oversight," seethed Oleana. "My God, out of two-hundred, only a quarter?"</p>

<p>"It's not that big of a fiscal loss..." Cade tried to interject.</p>

<p>"Fiscal? Those poor Pokémon endured torture for no reason and you're worried about our profit margin!" snapped Oleana.</p>

<p>"Well that's our goal, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He was only making Oleana's ire greater. Rose shifted his posture slightly but spoke with perhaps unwarranted levity, "I'm sure it won't happen again, now that our people know the limits of the procedure."</p>

<p>"It's my fault," she lamented.</p>

<p>"How can you say that?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have even designed the concept."</p>

<p>Rose sighed.</p>

<p>Archer and Kris, meanwhile, were listening and watching everything that transpired. "What's wrong with those Pokémon?" whispered Kris.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is," replied Archer with admiring awe, "in the amount of time I've smuggled contraband for Team Rocket, I've never seen Pokémon act so vicious."</p>

<p>"I was looking at the ones that are silent," Kris mentioned, less enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Now that he got a better look at it, there <i>was</i> something odd about the caged Pokémon. The creatures' reactions all seemed equally divided between maniacal rage and spiritless apathy, none of which he had ever witnessed to this extent in animals. Most Pokémon were at least somewhat approachable, even the wild ones that sprang out from tall grass to defend their territory, and all had life in their eyes. "You're right, Kris. What did they do to them?" he wondered aloud.</p>

<p>Oleana was still talking. "I expected... I don't know what I expected. I expected it'd make their powers stronger. I never expected it'd harm them."</p>

<p>"Oleana," replied Rose, "we have put a lot of funds in the research already. Do you really think there's no way to improve it?"</p>

<p>She gazed at him sorrowfully. "Could you, with a clear conscience, do this to more innocent Pokémon? Or perhaps eventually put our own Pokémon through such a procedure?"</p>

<p>Rose met her eyes, then those of the caged Pokémon, and shook his head. He looked at Cade. "Oleana's right. We're placing the Shadow Pokémon project on hold."</p>

<p>"But it works!" Cade was incensed. "And with Pokémon invulnerable to type-matching can you imagine how they would perform in the stadiums? You could rig battles and no one would be the wiser."</p>

<p>"I'm financing the project, not you," said Rose sternly.</p>

<p>The two men stared at each other, and it was Cade who relented. "Yes, Mr. Rose, you are."</p>

<p>Rose and Oleana turned to leave; Archer and Kris ducked down to avoid being seen by them as they passed by. "Somehow I doubt his intentions," Oleana was saying.</p>

<p>"My dear Oleana..." Rose replied moderately, "I do think you're letting your suspicions get carried away."</p>

<p>Archer signalled to Kris that they should get back, and they gingerly crept away. In so doing, Eevee's tail brushed against the shovel propped against the wall.</p>

<p>It clattered to the floor.</p>

<p>The Mightyena sniffing the air growled.</p>

<p>Archer didn't have to know any more. They hadn't seen them, but they'd been discovered all the same. Yanking Kris towards the main corridor he ordered, "We've got to go; now!"</p>

<p>Not fast enough, before Cade noticed the swing doors in motion, and quickly realized something was amiss. He stiffened adamantly as he turned to the guards:</p>

<p>"There's a spy. Get them."</p><hr />

<p>They raced back to the storage room as fast as they could. Kris had recalled Eevee and was rounding the corner only for Archer to yank her back.</p>

<p>A cluster of Cipher guards stood down the hallway, directly in front of the storage room, and alongside them stood two muscular fighting type Pokémon known as Machoke.</p>

<p>There was no way back to the Under.</p>

<p>Steps gaining on them, Archer and Kris fled in an alternate direction, ending up at a small part of the laboratory with several microscopes and an unlocked cabinet. They were cornered.</p>

<p>Thinking fast, Archer pushed Kris to the cabinet.</p>

<p>"Quick, hide in here," he urged.</p>

<p>She started to hide only to suddenly pull away. "There's not enough space for you."</p>

<p>"That's exactly why it'll work," Archer pointed out grimly. "They know there's a spy, not how many spies."</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide. "I'm not leaving you!" Kris protested.</p>

<p>"You're a Team Rocket agent, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Kris' objection caught in her throat. The sounds of searchers were drawing near; Archer spoke with whispered urgency:</p>

<p>"What matters is taking the information to headquarters. Whatever happens you get out of Orre and get back to Kanto." The sternness of his gaze softened. "I know what I'm doing. And I don't want you to get hurt."</p>

<p>He pushed her in without letting her say another word and turned about, setting loose Houndoom from its Poké Ball at the instant Cipher guards broke in.</p>

<p>"Inferno!" he cried, and Houndoom unleashed a wave of fire forcing their pursuers back. One of them sent out an otterlike Pokémon known as a Buizel, which responded with an assault of water that hurled against Houndoom; the two Pokémon ended up wrestling violently till the guards sent out two other Pokémon to the attack, and seeing Houndoom thus vanquished Archer recalled it.</p>

<p>That left him to contend with them himself, but Cipher's strength paled in comparison to the military-grade training so notorious of Team Rocket. He managed to keep the Pokémon at bay long enough to grab hold of one of the Cipher guards as a shield right as Mayor Cade strolled over, and Archer produced his gun and pointed it at the guard's head.</p>

<p>"Back off, or you'll have one less employee," threatened Archer.</p>

<p>"Some people are expendable," Cade responded, and without emotion pulled out a pistol and shot the man.</p>

<p>Before Archer could react, one of the Cipher minions struck his wrist and knocked the gun out of his hand. Immediately he was outnumbered by armed guards, who seized him roughly by the shoulders as Mayor Cade came to stand directly before him.</p>

<p>"My, aren't we privileged to have such distinguished company? None other than one of the esteemed Team Rocket admins: Mr. Archer Verdi."</p>

<p>"You recognize me? I'm flattered." Archer's voice was smooth. "I can't say I know who the hell you are."</p>

<p>"Evice S. Cade, Mayor of Phenac City."</p>

<p>"And what are you doing all the way out here, Mr. Mayor... embezzling tax dollars or rigging votes?" Archer quipped, only to get struck in the stomach by one of the guards. He bent over, clenching his teeth on a hiss of pain.</p>

<p>Cade grabbed his hair and forced him to look back up. "Very amusing. But since you came so far from Kanto, why don't I <i>show</i> you what I'm doing here?"</p>

<p>Giving a sharp signal to the guards Cade walked ahead, and their prisoner was dutifully made to follow.</p>

<p>As soon as they'd gone, Kris crept out of hiding and decided to trail them. <i>I know Archer said to get back to headquarters ASAP, but if I can at least find out where they'll be holding him it'll be easier to mount a rescue mission,</i> she justified to herself as she began picking her way after them, being sure to stay both at an unnoticeable distance and always hidden.</p>

<p>They eventually came to an area of the laboratory with what looked like an unusual laser of some kind suspended from the ceiling. Directly under the ray, in the center of the platform, was a wide metal table that looked like the huge examining platforms and operating theatres one might find at a Pokémon Center, easily large enough to accommodate a recumbent Charizard. Monitors on an elaborate control panel a few paces away appeared to measure all vital signs from whatever creature was placed atop the table, as well as the laser's output.</p>

<p>"Cipher found Team Rocket's research into radio waves and Pokémon evolution to be very interesting," Cade expounded. "However, while your people were playing at being radio disc-jockeys we took that technology to its logical conclusion." He gestured to the apparatus. "We've pioneered a process that strips away all weaknesses from a Pokémon."</p>

<p>"Are you saying a fire type would be invulnerable to water attacks?" Archer asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," Cade affirmed, "but it's not the only thing it strips away. It strips away their very personality. They become shadows of their former selves, for us to modify as we like. You might say they're living weapons. Personally I favor the term battle machines."</p>

<p>Granted, the idea of eliminating a Pokémon's natural weaknesses sounded exactly like the kind of strength Team Rocket sought. Archer couldn't place it though; something about the rest of it was...wrong. For all he diminished the notion of their business having rules, maybe there <i>was</i> a line not to be crossed.</p>

<p>"You know I already have a few of your lower-rank in my pocket," admitted Cade. "The liquidation of Krieger in your Lavender Town division left me with an unfortunate but permissible loss. How much does it take to buy an admin?"</p>

<p>"We're priceless. In any event I only seek the glory of Team Rocket," retorted Archer. "Now are you going to get to the point, or is the monologue the point?"</p>

<p>“I've always wondered what would happen if a <i>human being</i> was subjected to the ray.”</p>

<p>The fullness of meaning could barely be processed before the Cipher men seized Archer and yanked him to the platform. Archer struggled viciously and succeeded in kicking one of the guards, but there were far too many; he was overpowered and forced to lie back. The restraints were built in to the table and adjustable to any species, to his dismay, though it was only when one tightened around his neck to force his head still that he was fully immobilized. He could hear Cade laughing, and was barely able to see him standing alongside the laser controls out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Oh don't get too anxious," Cade taunted, a grin spreading across his face, "I'm sure your brain will fry long before you become a mindless shell."</p>

<p>"You think Giovanni will let this go?" Archer demanded. "All of Team Rocket will..."</p>

<p>"...die avenging your death," Cade cut him off, flipping a switch on the control panel.</p>

<p>The whine of the laser overhead charging power made him jolt. It drew his attention up to the ceiling, where his sight fell upon the ominously glowing device pointed precisely at his forehead. His stomach plummeted with fear and it was in that split second Archer realized he had no chance to save himself, right before the beam flared to life.</p>

<p>What followed was chaos in agony. Everything was pain; pain so overwhelming it made his entire body convulse in a helpless attempt to wrest away from the energy spearing through his skull, and all at once nothing made any sense. It was like a rainbow had exploded and the world became a vertigo of flashing lights and kaleidoscopic colors. He didn't know where he was anymore. He couldn't remember. The mercy of steady thought had become unattainable, and it was impossible to shield himself from the searing, dazzling ray or stop his heart's erratic racing. He would have cursed at Cade if he could only have focused his mind on anything other than his present torture long enough.</p>

<p>The beam held sustained, and though he tried to hold out as long as he could, a primaeval reflex for some kind of relief tore to pieces his dignity and cherished pride. Archer ended up screaming.</p>

<p>From her hiding-place Kris watched in horror, unable to help her brother. Even if she could have somehow driven off all the Cipher guards, how could she even begin to neutralize the laser? From an outsiders' vantage point, the beam of energy looked less like concentrated light and more like the stripe of a Vantablack void, with a surrounding glow so deeply purple it bordered upon indigo; something so eerie she could not even recall having seen any Pokémon attack like it. She felt utterly sick to her stomach, and – remembering Archer's urgent request that she get the information back to Team Rocket headquarters – she forced herself away from what she was sure were his death throes and fled.</p><hr />

<p>Exhaustion won over stamina. Blotched patterns wove over his vision like lace, heralding the fine whistle of a coming faint. And when the pain at last began to fade into numbness, Archer gave up struggling and accepted it.</p>

<p>With no way back to the Under, and needing to flee the laboratory before Cipher realized there had been not one spy but two, Kris had little option but to take her chances in the desert.</p>

<p>Orre's wilderness was so arid that nothing survived there, not even plants. There was only miles and miles of sand and savage wind, and the combination of these things melded into a curse. Two hours of walking later, the wind picked up drastically; around the same time she was fortunate enough to find a rocky cliffside with a narrow cavern in the midst of the desert, and was forced to seek shelter from the night's rising sandstorm.</p>

<p>"No wonder no Pokémon live out there," she mused, staring out at the gale.</p>

<p>Eevee's Poké Ball was shaking restlessly, and Kris unlocked and opened it, allowing the little animal to spring out.</p>

<p>"It's okay now; we're out of the sandstorm," Kris told it. "But we're probably stranded until the sandstorm passes."</p>

<p>Eevee turned to look out at the storm.</p>

<p>Her whole body ached tremendously from having walked so far. Kris buried her face in her hands, trying hard to think about her current predicament and not that last glimpse of her brother seared into her mind. He was probably dead. He was dead and they had not even had the humanity to kill him quickly.</p>

<p>Soft paws began poking at her arm, and Kris glanced towards Eevee. The little animal squeaked as if trying to console.</p>

<p>She scooped up her pet and clutched it firmly as it snuggled up to her.</p>

<p><i>There's nothing we can do except tell headquarters. There's still a chance he's alive,</i> she reassured herself, <i>what would they get out of killing him, really?</i></p>

<p>That however meant he was still likely going through hell, and she dismally found there was no reassurance anywhere.</p><hr />

<p>Kris wasn't sure when she fell asleep, but the next morning she woke with the sound of a thump from outside the cave and the low growl of a Pokémon.</p>

<p>Eevee leapt from where it had been curled up sleeping on her lap and scampered blithely towards the sound.</p>

<p>"Eevee, wait!" Kris called, her stomach clenching. What if Cipher tracked her all the way out here?</p>

<p>She instead heard what sounded like a friendly greeting towards Eevee, and she emerged tentatively to find a man about 30 or so in age, without any purple neckerchief – at least that was a good sign, she thought. He was riding a dragon Pokémon.</p>

<p>When he saw her, he remarked, "I didn't expect to find anyone here. Were you training your Pokémon at the mountain base too?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and he introduced himself, "My name's Vander."</p>

<p>"I'm Kris, and this is my Eevee," she reciprocated. "Excuse me, but do you happen to know where we are on a map? I'm trying to get to the nearest town and got stranded by the sandstorm."</p>

<p>"You're at Mount Battle."</p>

<p>Evidently she must have looked mystified, for he proceeded to explain:</p>

<p>"It's really Mount Eclo; it connects with Eclo Canyon north of here. But because of the Pokémon battle tournaments that take place at its summit, everyone calls it Mount Battle. I'm one of the managers."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could give me a ride up there?" Kris asked hopefully, "I've got to contact someone."</p>

<p>"Sure, hop on," he offered, and she quickly scooped up her Eevee and joined him astride the dragon.</p><hr />

<p>Kris rode with Vander up to Mount Battle's reception area, where she contacted Team Rocket headquarters from a public telephone. A helicopter was immediately sent to retrieve her, and she was taken to the casino in Celadon City to speak with the boss about what had transpired.</p>

<p>Silence enveloped Giovanni's office as Kris finished telling the story of Archer's capture. Jessie and James just looked at each other as if in shock, but Giovanni's face was unreadable. It was void of emotion; whatever he felt, whatever he thought, was kept deep within. At that moment, one of the Team Rocket minions arrived, saluted the boss and produced a note.</p>

<p>"A messenger Pidgey brought this letter."</p>

<p>Giovanni took the note and as the minion left, he read the note aloud:</p>

<p>
  <i>Archer Verdi does not exist anymore</i>
</p>

<p>Kris let out a gasp and tears welled up in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make them all pay for what they did to my brother!" she vowed.</p>

<p>"You are part of Team Rocket now," Giovanni reminded her, "You take orders and my orders to you are to take some time off."</p>

<p>"With respect sir...you certainly don't expect me to do nothing!" said Kris in exasperation.</p>

<p>"You are not in the right frame of mind to work... You are too emotional and need to calm down."</p>

<p> "But...I want to be a part of the action," she insisted.</p>

<p>"You are going to take a couple of weeks off!" Giovanni raised his voice, "I decide when and what punishment is given...and to whom."</p>

<p>Kris bowed her head. "Yes sir; sorry sir," she said, remembering the important protocol of behaviour her brother Archer had taught her... '<i>Never</i> argue with the boss.' </p>

<p>"Go," he said tersely, and she turned around and left the office.</p>

<p>"James," added the Team Rocket boss, "Close the door." </p>

<p>James did as ordered, and took his place standing next to Jessie with Meowth sitting at their heels. They awaited further instructions.</p>

<p>"We'll have to hit back some time by the end of the week," Giovanni said coldly. "Make inquiries and find out who are Rose's top people. Start with finding out the name of the man she saw ordering Cipher subordinates at the laboratory."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," replied James firmly.</p>

<p>Persian gave a few loud meows, which culminated in a growl. Giovanni translated them, "Persian wonders why they would do such a thing. It's almost like they're trying to goad us into attacking. ...I'm inclined to agree with you, Persian," he answered, "however if we don't act at all, it makes us appear weak, as well as sends the message to our associates that we would not retaliate should any harm befall <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>Stillness fell over the office. Giovanni sat back in his office chair pensively and nobody dared speak until he did.</p>

<p>"He will have to answer my questions himself," he finally stated.</p>

<p>Picking up the phone, Giovanni called Rose Industries' headquarters and when the switchboard answered, Giovanni got to the point.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Giovanni Delavita, head of Rocket Enterprises...I want to speak with Mr. Linford Rose."</p>

<p>"Yes sir." The voice on the other end asked no questions, and within seconds Mr. Rose appeared on the line.</p>

<p>"Greetings Giovanni...how may I be of service?" he said sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Forget the courtesies, Rose... I'll get to the point... You have my godson, Archer, and I want him back."</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence on the other end of the line and then Rose spoke up, "I have no idea what you're talking about Delavita."</p>

<p>This statement infuriated Giovanni and his temper briefly broke through his calm demeanor, "You know damn well what I'm talking about, we just got your message about his demise!"</p>

<p>"I sent you no message."</p>

<p>"Like hell you didn't! We want the remains back to give him a proper funeral."</p>

<p>"Giovanni, you need to check on those you've got surrounding you, because I did not send you any message; nor do I have any of your people as hostages, dead or alive."</p>

<p>"This will not end well for you Rose," the head of Team Rocket said through gritted teeth and hung up the phone.</p>

<p>Giovanni turned sharply to Jessie and James.</p>

<p>"You're going to Orre tomorrow. Deliver this to Mr. Rose, on behalf of my godson." And without further elaboration Giovanni took the rose from his lapel and tossed it to James, who caught it easily by the stem.</p>

<p>Jessie gave a swift nod. "We're on it, sir," she replied.</p>

<p>Inwardly though, both she and James grimaced. They'd wanted free time to continue spying on the twerp and his Pikachu. A trip to Orre had not been on their list of plans at all.</p>

<p>But, one did not argue with the boss. And, moreover, Archer had been part of the team, and a friend – and no one had the right to execute an agent of Team Rocket but the Team Rocket syndicate itself.</p><hr />

<p>Rose meanwhile had hung up the phone on his end, and was thinking over the conversation when Oleana walked into the office.</p>

<p>She noticed his concerned look immediately as she walked up to his side. "Linford, are you all right?"</p>

<p>Rose spun around on his office chair to face her and asked, "Oleana... remember all the times you've told me that you distrusted Cade; that there's something about him..."</p>

<p>"Yes Linford. Primarily the fact that he stares at me with lust. Total lack of respect...after all he knows you and I are husband and wife."</p>

<p>"Something else, my darling... You said something about how you thought him capable of treason."</p>

<p>"Absolutely," she confirmed. "Honestly, Cade has trouble wafting off him in waves."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you what Giovanni said to me," Rose responded as he took her gently by the arm and sat her down in a chair next to him. He proceeded to tell her the intriguing conversation that had taken place with the head of Team Rocket.</p>

<p>Oleana listened to the whole dialogue and then gave a brisk nod of her head, as if all that he recounted had affirmed her suspicions. "This sounds like Cade might have done something behind our backs, and Giovanni is blaming us. I'm worried about this Linford."</p>

<p>"He already gave a heads up about getting his revenge," Rose said sourly, "the usual line about how it won't end well..."</p>

<p>"Darling," Oleana got up from her seat and wrapped her arms around him, "We mustn't let this go on...one thing is our disagreement with Giovanni over the wild Mew, but if Cade is behind the disappearance of Giovanni's godson, it means he is deliberately trying to start an all-out conflict between Team Rocket and our syndicate Cipher."</p>

<p>"I agree," Rose said, "but quite frankly, I'm not sure what to do about it."</p><hr />

<p>Kris didn't know what to do. Her entire soul was filled with vindictive fury. She desperately wanted to avenge Archer somehow, but she wasn't about to disobey the boss.</p>

<p>As she strolled all the way to the Celadon department store, Eevee padding along at her side, she briefly noticed a billboard advertising the Fuchsia City zoo and stopped before it.</p>

<p>Other than Celadon City, she hadn't been to any other towns in Kanto. Her brother had said <i>he'd show her them</i>...</p>

<p>Kris shook away her thoughts, which alternately were depressing or enraging. She couldn't do anything about it now. Giovanni would find a way to avenge him – that much she was sure – and she didn't want to return to Johto just yet to finish off her collection of badges; she wanted to be nearby in case Giovanni had an update and could tell her in person.</p>

<p>"Well Eevee..." she said, glancing at her Pokémon, "if we have nothing else to occupy us for a few weeks, then what do you think about visiting Fuchsia City?"</p>

<p>Eevee squeaked in agreement and hopped onto her shoulder.</p>

<p>"To anyone who pledges loyalty to me," said Cade emphatically, "I will double what Mr. Rose pays you."</p>

<p>Cade knew he was making a bold move, but he figured there could be no bolder move than what he had already done. If Rose and Oleana discovered that instead of ceasing the Shadow Pokémon project, he had chosen to continue it – and what was more, experiment on a person, even if he'd used someone from Team Rocket – he would surely be expelled from Cipher.</p>

<p>So why not make Cipher his own?</p>

<p>He had hence gathered the entire contingent of Cipher henchmen who worked under him at the laboratory; and when they all stood before him in the main area, he laid forth his proposal inviting them to join him. It was a risky investment that Cade felt would surely pay off. He'd made a similar and successful proposition to quite a few low-rank Team Rocket agents, such as Krieger, who expressed dissatisfaction with Giovanni's 'rules' of how the syndicate should conduct business.</p>

<p>With Rose's employees, the deciding factor was not one of idealism but of practicality. Some of the Cipher minions looked hesitant at the offer but most were convinced; Orrean opportunism lent itself to mercenary tendencies, which Cade – being of a naturally opportunistic inclination himself – found easy to take advantage of.</p>

<p>He was frankly surprised there were any holdouts at all. But that could be remedied.</p>

<p>Cade pointed imperiously at the reluctant minions. "Apprehend them and place them in the holding area till I give further instruction," he ordered, whereupon the guards now loyal to him instantly aimed their weapons at the others.</p>

<p>There was astonishment among the newfound captives and, from some, a show of defiance. One of them scoffed bravely at him. "If you intend to kill us, then why don't you shoot us here?"</p>

<p>Cade smiled wryly. "I don't intend to kill you. I intend to kill your minds."</p>

<p>The image they had all witnessed of Archer writhing and screaming in agony was terrifying enough without imagination painting their own little nightmares from a palette of deductions. Cade stifled a malicious snicker as he watched how several of them went pale at the thought, and they were ushered away at gunpoint. He'd deal with them later.</p>

<p>From the main area of the laboratory, Cade retreated into an inner section where he'd stationed a couple of guards before the entrance to a small room, where he was currently holding his most interesting prisoner.</p>

<p>Archer lay unconscious on the bed. He had not stirred since passing out under the energy beam, and with his blood pressure plummeting they had rushed to cover him with blankets and administer an injection to counteract it before he went into shock.</p>

<p>Morbid curiosity outweighed a sense of humanity for Cade. What had started as a particularly inventive way to commit murder was becoming fiendishly tantalizing with potential. He had expected Archer to die immediately, and since he hadn't Cade now wanted to see how far could he go.</p>

<p>Was it possible to harness the will of a human being like one did with a Pokémon?</p>

<p>Maybe it was a conceptual argument; certainly it was a subjective one. There was probably morality involved too, but he couldn't care less about that.</p>

<p>Cade held a Poké Ball, which he had procured from one of the many crates sent by the Silph Company. The possibility was tempting, and he could technically begin now, but he wanted Archer awake. He wanted him to realize what was happening.</p>

<p>"I'll be in my office on-site... Bring him to me when he wakes up," Cade told one of the guards succinctly, and headed on his way.</p><hr />

<p>It was one hour later when Archer awoke, with a terrible migraine. His blurred vision focused on the ceiling and instantly flinched away from the light; the pain seemed to concentrate in the center of his forehead, for some reason.</p>

<p>He did not know where he was. He knew <i>who</i> he was, and who he <i>worked</i> for, but everything else was a blur. Searching himself, Archer found all his possessions gone, from his wallet to Houndoom's Poké Ball, and no clue as to what had happened.</p>

<p>Archer's mind wavered, his memories clouded so as to be indistinct and tumultuous. Something – <em>something</em> had brought him to this terrible state; but what, he could barely remember.</p>

<p>He looked over to the side and noticed a guard had been posted as a lookout. The guard, upon seeing him awake, immediately called others. Two more guards arrived and before Archer could react they pulled him out of bed, hauling him to an adjoining room where Cade was seated at a large wooden desk.</p>

<p>"Amazing that you survived," Cade said, with what seemed like genuine interest.</p>

<p>The roles had reversed. Being a Team Rocket admin, Archer was accustomed to being the interrogator; now he was the target. It would have made it all the more terrifying for Archer, who could only imagine Cade would be as unsympathetic as he in his position, if he had felt any emotion at all. He felt only a strange void.</p>

<p><i>Perhaps it's for the best,</i> he thought. He knew not to display his emotions before an enemy, and had never been one to do so.</p>

<p>Cade waited till Archer was securely bound by rope between two columns before stepping forwards. The guards retreated to the edges of the room, present in case they would be called on, though Cade doubted he would require their assistance. Without putting away the first Poké Ball, he retrieved a second from his pocket and sent out the Pokémon within.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you to my Pokémon partner," he introduced it almost jovially, motioned to the creature as he put away its capsule. "This is my Espeon."</p>

<p>Espeon sat in a neat lump with its paws tucked underneath it, shaping its lithe form almost like a bread loaf as it observed Archer. It was an Eevee evolution, diurnal yet catlike, with velvet lavender-white fur and a tapered, forked tail. A red gemstone, not unlike that of Giovanni's Persian, graced its forehead.</p>

<p>Archer glanced from the Pokémon back to Cade, who still held the initial Poké Ball in one hand. Archer knew it wasn't Espeon's, and guessed whatever Pokémon was in there would be the next stage of his torment.</p>

<p>"All Espeon," continued Cade, "as you probably have heard, are able to hone in on thoughts. If you hope to keep secrets, you'll soon find Espeon is my efficient little lie detector."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" asked Archer dubiously.</p>

<p>"From you? Nothing," Cade replied. "I want to train you."</p>

<p>Archer sneered back. "I'm not an animal."</p>

<p>"Yet," Cade replied, then said to Espeon, "Zap Cannon."</p>

<p>An orb of golden electricity and fire coalesced in midair, like conjured ball lightning, and with a swing of Espeon's head it spun towards Archer and struck him headlong. Searing pain coursed through his body and he cried out, his skin sizzling audibly as he tried to wrest free. The ropes held fast.</p>

<p>"The first part of the training," Cade remarked nonchalantly, "is for you to acknowledge who owns you."</p>

<p>"You fucking asshole..." His offense cut off as he was shocked yet again. Electricity once more assailed with fiery fury, and Archer could not hold his tongue till the pain subsided, leaving a burnt scent in the air and a sour taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>"My associates within Team Rocket," said Cade, "know enough about you to tell me you're one of the syndicate's most loyal admins, with dreams and goals for your organization. That is precisely why I think you're someone I can reason with. You told me you seek the glory of Team Rocket. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," snapped Archer, still gasping from the shock.</p>

<p>"Giovanni is destroying your organization," Cade claimed. "He's planning to disband Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"You're lying. Why would he do that?"</p>

<p>"For his son, a certain Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town."</p>

<p>The name 'Ketchum' sounded familiar to Archer. He recalled his godfather Giovanni having mentioned it once, just once, in the context of <i>Delia</i> Ketchum. Did he have a child with her? It was the first Archer had heard of it, but not unlikely.</p>

<p>"Giovanni's giving up on Team Rocket." Cade was adamant. "Why do you think he wants Silph Co. so badly? Because then he can retire. His plan is either to disband Team Rocket, or turn it over to his son Ash. And his son is absolutely one of those self-righteous idealists who believes crime never pays and will tear down the empire without a second thought. All our ancestors will have died futilely and if you don't help me stop it, you will be complicit."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, <i>our</i> ancestors?"</p>

<p>Cade hesitated. A slip of the tongue had revealed, early, far more than he would have liked. But the possibility of what still could be remained tantalizingly in reach and he laughed it off.</p>

<p>"Why don't I let you think that over? We have plenty of time here." He hinted at a threat.</p>

<p>Archer disregarded it. "Till Giovanni sends people to kill you, that is."</p>

<p>His brave comeback was met with another burning electric shock by Espeon. He slumped against the ropes.</p>

<p>Cade didn't reply at all, instead fiddling with the Poké Ball he held till he saw his prisoner's breath steady. "You don't believe our business has rules, do you Archer?"</p>

<p>"No," Archer choked out.</p>

<p>"Then why are you going to play by them?"</p>

<p>Archer didn't know what Cade was aiming at, but he could fathom it was nothing good. He had to bide his time; he only had to endure long enough for rescue.</p>

<p>In the meantime Archer tried to guess what kind of Pokémon was in Cade's Poké Ball. Without holding it himself, there was no way to estimate by how heavy it seemed to be; then again, even the heaviest Pokémon like a Snorlax could easily be carried about, with only slight difference in weight. The way Cade held the capsule, it seemed light, and for a moment Archer even wondered if it was empty before deciding that would serve no purpose here. The Pokémon within it must be something naturally small.</p>

<p>"You don't even agree with half of Giovanni's decisions," Cade was saying. "Why do you abide by them?"</p>

<p>"Giovanni is the leader of Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"Pathetic, the way you go groveling to Giovanni. Do you think he gives a shit about you? Where is he now? Letting you rot in our little dungeon?"</p>

<p>"Giovanni's forces are already on their way. He'd never abandon any of his people."</p>

<p>"Oh really? Do you know how long you've been here?"</p>

<p>A vicious retort faltered in Archer's throat.</p>

<p>Cade did not let the advantage go. "How long do you think you've been here? Weeks? Months?"</p>

<p>When Archer didn't reply, Espeon shocked him. "I'm not sure," he admitted through gasps.</p>

<p>"You've been here longer than you think," answered Cade tersely. "You don't even know for sure how long you were unconscious. Or how long we kept you unconscious."</p>

<p>The implication he'd been drugged brought further doubt into his mind. Archer caught himself involuntarily wondering, <i>Was I really left for dead?</i></p>

<p>Cade's venomous insinuations began to take form in Archer's tormented mind. Giovanni as leader, and the glory of Team Rocket; weren't the two things inextricable? He'd made a mistake, picturing a rescue at all. He'd made another mistake in believing Team Rocket could never fall.</p>

<p>The worst mistake of all, however, was when he stopped hearing and started <i>listening</i>. For an instant, Cade's words were no longer anathema but logical in their own way. That was when Archer saw his entire worldview as pitifully ridiculous.</p>

<p>And that was when Cade knew it was possible.</p>

<p>"It's one thing to torture a person until they crack. It's another to keep going until they shatter into a million pieces. Do you comprehend my vision?"</p>

<p>Cade grinned evilly.</p>

<p>"We're throwing the shards of glass into the fire and reforging them into whatever we wish. And when they're pulled from the flames they will never be able to return to what they were. You can't imagine how this will turn out for you," Cade added. "I hold your life in the palm of my hand."</p>

<p>Archer could see his fingers tighten around the Poké Ball. Up to a point he wanted him to throw it already. He wanted to know what he was up against. "But not my will," he pointed out with defiance.</p>

<p>He watched Cade draw in a breath. Then with a sweeping gesture, the ropes tethering Archer loosened and fell away via Espeon's psychic energy.</p>

<p>"Sit."</p>

<p>Archer stared at him rather mystified, as if he didn't believe what he'd heard.</p>

<p>Cade made a quick movement with his hand, palm down. "On your knees, on the floor."</p>

<p>"Fuck you," Archer countered.</p>

<p>The gemstone on Espeon's forehead gleamed, and Archer was both seized with pain as well as pulled to his knees violently by psychic force. He winced as he struck the ground, but he was only held down for a moment, long enough to register his sitting position, before the energy pressure lifted away and he was allowed to rise.</p>

<p>Cade kept condescending patience. "Again. Sit."</p>

<p>He shot his tormentor a spiteful look, but Archer saw little point now in fighting the demand further. With measured, reluctant motions, he sat neatly on the floor facing Cade.</p>

<p>"Well done. Now let's see you react faster, with only a signal."</p>

<p>"I'm not your Pokémon," Archer snapped at him, still sitting.</p>

<p>He only succeeded in getting Cade to seize him roughly by the nape of the neck.</p>

<p>"Let me outline it for you, since you're evidently too dumb to reason it yourself. You <i>are</i> the same as the Shadow Pokémon, and you should be <i>happy</i> you're the same. It means if you're obedient, your miserable life actually has some value. Your only purpose is to be used."</p>

<p>"With one caveat," retorted Archer, and despite his fatigue, a remaining spark shone defiantly in his eyes. "I'm a human being."</p>

<p>Cade regarded him coldly. He released him, took a step back, and finally hurled the Poké Ball...</p>

<p>...at <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The sphere struck his arm lightly, and Archer could only gaze at it for a single incredulous moment before it snapped open and the world flashed into darkness.</p>

<p>Immediately he was in a small room about five paces in all directions, with curved windowless walls divided horizontally by a single thin line, and to one side what looked like a large metal clasp upon a circular indent; as he stood up, he could see the ceiling and the floor each bore a single glowing circle in their center, flooding the room with red light.</p>

<p>It took Archer a moment to deduce what happened. When he did, dread seized him as he remembered what the red light meant.</p>

<p>It was scanning him. It was sequencing his DNA pattern. And he realized he had only a short amount of time before he'd be irreversibly tied to the capsule like an animal.</p>

<p>"No...no, no, no, no." He had to figure out how to get out. He had to <i>get out, damn it!</i></p>

<p>He raced from one wall to the other in a frenzy. Finding nothing that looked like an escape, he tried to tackle one side of the enclosure. He stumbled against the curve of the wall. It didn't budge.</p>

<p>The red light dimmed before gradually returning to full strength, apparently pulsing slowly.</p>

<p>Then he took notice again of the clasp, off to the side, inching down at intervals like the seconds-hand of a clock.</p>

<p>It was <i>locking</i>.</p>

<p>He was instantly at the latch, trying to force it back up. It was nearly the same height he was, and he grabbed it with both his hands and tugged – and tugged again. Direly weak from the torture he'd endured, Archer struggled futilely.</p>

<p>He had no strength to force it open.</p>

<p>The red light continued to dim and pulse incrementally as he wrenched rearward as hard as he could, the muscles of his arms and back ablaze with pain. His shoes slid on the curved surface of the wall's edge where it met the floor.</p>

<p>His hands lost their grip and slipped off the metal.</p>

<p>"—shit!" Archer cursed as he fell, nearly hitting his head in the process. The clasp continued moving down.</p>

<p>Grabbing hold of the latch anew, he pulled. Everything was awash in the ominous red glow, making it hard to see what he was doing. Heaving back with the last of his might, groaning from strenuous effort, Archer succeeded in halting the large fixture's descent...the mechanism creaked and pushed stubbornly against his force...he held tight...</p>

<p>He lost his grip again. It lurched forwards relentlessly. In a last desperate attempt, he threw his whole body against the clasp, to no avail; with a click, the latch came down fully and locked. The red light scanning him shut off.</p>

<p>Archer screamed in frustrated anguish.</p>

<p>Cade watched the Poké Ball shake a couple of times before it grew still, and the rapidly flickering red light finally shut off having registered a successful capture. The Cipher guards exchanged a glance, mutely horrified at what they'd witnessed, but they knew better than to say a word as he approached the locked Poké Ball and picked it up.</p>

<p>The bright red-and-white sphere was indistinguishable from any other, save for its highly illegal contents. What he'd done was considered a violation of human rights. But after forced experimentation and torture, so what if he committed one more?</p>

<p>Cade smiled indulgently. "Gotcha."</p>

<p>The natural luminosity of refined tumblestone walls imbued the small chamber with a perpetual twilight, so Archer was not in total darkness. It was the kind of mild and warm light that would have otherwise been calming, had it been the parlor of a cabin or a cozy bedroom; here it was but a condolence. He could not tell whether he was up or down or sideways; for his perception he was upright, but it was the same way one could not properly perceive standing on the planet's round face – that much he knew of the inner workings of Poké Balls.</p>

<p>The Poké Ball was locked. Once a Pokémon was successfully captured, no amount of force from inside could unlock the capsule.</p>

<p><i>Poké Balls are designed to hold in even a Charizard,</i> Archer reflected, letting himself sink wearily to the ground. <i>There's no way I can hope to get out. I have no choice but to wait until someone unlocks it from outside.</i></p>

<p>Time stretched out strangely, in a manner reminiscent of when he'd been a child, but more so; as if his prison had some bearing on his grasp of time's passage. Hours dragged on <i>ad infinitum</i> and prolonged isolation preyed upon his nerves. At least he could hear what was outside of the capsule. It sounded muffled and drawn out, but still distinguishable, reminiscent of being underwater.</p>

<p>He sat pressed against one of the curved walls, introspective and downcast. The burns left from Espeon's electric attacks still hurt, but not as much as thinking Giovanni would have abandoned him to his fate. His emotions, it seemed, came at moments; flares of despondency and fear that receded as swiftly as they came, and one of the few things that could bring them to the forefront was the thought he'd been forsaken. Archer was starting to believe there was no other explanation for his captivity. As such, he'd have to think of a way to escape by himself.</p>

<p>His chance would come when he was let out. It was a waiting game. Patience was all he needed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his nature was one of impatience.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do here. He was alone, and hungry, and cold. He wished he had a blanket. Or food.</p>

<p>He wondered where Houndoom was, and who they'd given him to. He knew fully well how that went; subdue the trainer, and steal the Pokémon. What was new and enigmatic was their apparent interest in keeping him alive.</p>

<p>Why did Cade say he wanted him alive, anyway? To use him? And what did he mean about their ancestors?</p>

<p>...God, he was hungry.</p>

<p>Feeling more despondent than he'd yet been, Archer lay down and tucked himself into a fetal position, trying to keep warm and welcoming the oblivion of dreamless sleep when it came.</p><hr />

<p>He woke who-knows-how-much-time later to a sharp click. Groggily looking up, he noticed the clasp had returned to its unlocked position.</p>

<p>Archer unsteadily scrambled to his feet in time for the sudden black flash, finding himself outside of the Poké Ball in the laboratory office with the columns and the wooden desk. He spun around to find Cade holding the capsule in his hand, a smugly superior look on his captor's face.</p>

<p>Cipher guards immediately sprang to restrain him but Archer, struggling free, struck one and ran for it.</p>

<p>The world briefly flashed black, and suddenly he had to skid and catch himself before he collided with the wall and the lock. He was back in the Poké Ball.</p>

<p>Before Archer could fully come to grips with what had transpired, there was another flash and he was back outside.</p>

<p>This time he lunged straight for the Poké Ball, intending to snatch it away, just as Cade made a quick motion of his hand; the capsule opened instantly and then Archer was within its confines yet again.</p>

<p>Cade held back a snicker as he addressed his captive inside the sphere. "Archer, are we really going to have to play Poké Ball ping-pong like with a newly trapped Pokémon that hasn't been trained? You know fully well how these work. <i>You can't get away</i>."</p>

<p>Archer leant his forehead against the latch. It was true. He was acting like a wild Pokémon that still hadn't learnt who its master was. A wild Pokémon that hadn't wanted to be caught, but had to accept its new reality.</p>

<p>He snapped back to attention when he heard a new voice outside the Poké Ball; it was at a distance so he could not tell what had been said, but he recognized who it was.</p>

<p>
  <i>Oleana.</i>
</p>

<p>Cade swiftly put the Poké Ball aside on the desk and greeted the newcomers with a broad smile. "Mr. and Mrs. Rose! How unexpected."</p>

<p>Archer pressed against the wall to try to hear their conversation better. Rose was speaking to Cade.</p>

<p>"There's been an attempt on our lives. Someone put a bomb to our vehicle and it was only by the grace of God that no one was in it at the time. Oleana spied James and Jessie, two of Giovanni's most notorious elites, and their Meowth at a distance; we sent people after them but by that time they'd already returned to Team Rocket's territory."</p>

<p>"Look at the bright side. At least they failed their mission," Cade dismissed.</p>

<p>"When they tell Giovanni, he'll send more of his people and try again," Rose pointed out dryly.</p>

<p>"There's more..." Oleana added, "One of our top guards was found murdered in an alley alongside Team Rocket's signature rose. Commander Merardi, who'd been stationed here at the laboratory for a time."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do remember him. What a tragic loss," Cade replied with apparent sincerity, whilst trying to figure out which of the henchmen he'd been.</p>

<p>"We heard the agents responsible for <i>that</i> were tracking the Poké Ball shipment from Silph," Rose went on. "Have you seen anyone around here?"</p>

<p>"Around here? Ah...no," Cade prevaricated.</p>

<p>Archer was listening and felt a surge of hope. <i>So Rose and Oleana have nothing to do with this, if Cade's keeping me a secret from them!</i> Then it was some sort of internal power play by Cade, perhaps to overrule Rose in Cipher's ranks? Whatever it was, Archer immediately saw a chance for rescue.</p>

<p>Cade was assuring Rose, "If our people see anyone here, we'll be sure to deal with the situation accordingly."</p>

<p>"I know you're more than capable of it, but in this case I'd prefer you just inform me," answered Rose. "Giovanni's under the impression we've killed his godson, and I don't know what card's up his sleeve but as far as I'm concerned, never mind getting the Mew back...I want no war with Team Rocket under uncertain conditions. At this point I want them to stay on their territory, and we'll stay on ours."</p>

<p>Inside the Poké Ball, Archer was pounding at the wall.</p>

<p>"Help – I'm trapped here! Let me out!" He'd shouted his voice raw before remembering that even if Pokémon could hear the outer world from within their carriers, the outer world could not hear them.</p>

<p>With a surge of desperation, he put all his effort into tackling the clasp. It was futility at its finest. But at least he could draw attention.</p>

<p>Rose motioned to the Poké Ball atop the table, which was shaking. "Oh, it looks like one of the Pokémon wants to come out."</p>

<p>"They're just getting antsy because it's near feeding time," dismissed Cade easily. "Don't worry about it. I'll feed them after you've gone. ...You know we could use stronger Pokémon here just in case some folks from Team Rocket do show up. Perhaps if you left Zacian and Zamazenta here like guard dogs?" he added, silently envisioning how he could use Silph's modified Poké Balls to capture the Legendary wolves for himself when their trainer was not present.</p>

<p>Oleana, in response, gave a forced and acrid smile. "I don't think they'll take kindly to being ordered by anyone but me. If I'm not nearby it's a coin toss whether they'd think of you as a nuisance...or lunch."</p>

<p>Cade's sly grin faltered only a bit.</p>

<p>"Anyway," interjected Rose, "we came by to let you know to keep on the alert for Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"Oh, no need to worry about that. I'm as watchful as a Sentret," Cade told them, casting a second look at Oleana up and down. She had crossed her arms and was starting to appear irritated.</p>

<p>Never imagining the contents of the shaking Poké Ball on the table, Rose and Oleana bid farewell and departed. From inside the sphere, Archer heard their steps receding, and all at once his frustration boiled over into incoherent despair.</p>

<p>When he was sent out again, despair had turned to ire. No sooner did he emerge from the capsule did the guards fall upon him, and having anticipated as much he fought violently.</p>

<p>It was no use. There were too many. One of the guards punched him in the jaw, while others pulled his arms behind his back and he was struck mercilessly till he no longer struggled. Bruised and beaten, Archer was forced to the columns, where he was once again tied up to face a new round of 'training'. Cade watched with unmistakable amusement.</p>

<p>Groaning, Archer lifted his gaze and briefly met Espeon's. Something occurred to him; if Espeon could read his thoughts, then maybe he could talk with it unbeknownst to Cade. He wouldn't have much chance when the interrogation started, but maybe now... He tried to focus his attention on the Pokémon. <i>Espeon? Please, can't you help me get out of here?</i></p>

<p>Interest briefly lit in Espeon's eyes, as if it realized he was trying to communicate telepathically with it. It was only when Archer gave up trying to send a message when he received a wave of regret.</p>

<p>
  <i>I obey, master does not throw me to the shadow ray.</i>
</p>

<p><i>I'll protect you from whatever that is,</i> Archer projected back.</p>

<p>
  <i>You could not protect yourself. How could you protect me?</i>
</p>

<p>The answer was enigmatic to Archer. Espeon looked down at its paws, and there was no further communication save for another surge of regret. He would get no help from it.</p>

<p>Cade was already talking. "I presume your reflection has brought you new awareness of your position, and what your continued existence depends on. Perhaps it would help to delineate some facts. One of which is that you're alone."</p>

<p>He held something, and Archer gazed at it for a moment before some part of the memory returned. It was the family photograph from his wallet.</p>

<p>"Some of my contacts within Team Rocket tell me the infant in this picture is your sister Krystal...and she currently works alongside you in Team Rocket. Other than yourself, she's the last surviving member of your family after the hit by the Cadáins to wipe out the Delavitas – isn't that so?"</p>

<p>At a motion from Cade, Espeon brought forth another orb of fire and electricity, but instead of hurling it allowed it to levitate before its trainer. Its sparking, flickering fire illuminated the room in an eerie half-light, causing shadows to dance on the walls. Cade studied the image he held, and then regarded Archer with defined malice.</p>

<p>"We should have eradicated all of you from the face of the planet."</p>

<p>He dropped the image into the flames.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, Archer tried to leap and stop it, but the ropes held him and he could only watch the photograph crumble into cinders. Cade seemed to find entertainment in stirring up his captive's suppressed emotions into a tumult of anguish.</p>

<p>"You don't have a little sister. Your photograph never existed. She died one month before Giovanni established Team Rocket."</p>

<p>Archer felt sick to his stomach. Something about all Cade was doing crossed a line, far beyond even the cruelties his own syndicate would set forth in; Archer was sure he'd thought that before, but in any case he was thinking it now. In the same manner, something about it remained immensely familiar.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he forced himself to ask.</p>

<p>"My real name is Evice S. Cadáin."</p>

<p>"That's impossible."</p>

<p>"I figured 'Cade' sounds less ostentatious, and it doesn't carry the same connotations of Kanto mob wars my birth surname does. It's better for publicity."</p>

<p>"The Cadáins are all dead."</p>

<p>"I was the youngest of Mr. Cadáin's sons when he sought to seize territory... After Giovanni slaughtered what remained of my family, I fled to Orre. My grandfather was then mayor of Phenac City, and he brought me into the region's political circles to eventually inherit his position. Giovanni, with his oh-so-noble rules, thought it surrender. He never thought of the possibility it was temporary retreat and I'd harbor vendettas too."</p>

<p><i>Oh, if I could only get loose,</i> thought Archer. "Our families were at peace back then. Your family hit the Delavitas first. Giovanni's vengeance was justified."</p>

<p>"My family saw opportunity. Isn't it right to seize an opportunity where you can? You yourself tried to take the opportunity to escape."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't I try to escape? I'm being tortured."</p>

<p>"And the Delavitas were making it difficult for my family's business. It's competition."</p>

<p>Something there aligned incomparably, but Archer was too ill to figure out what it was. His breath was ragged and he wished he could lie down.</p>

<p>"The Delavitas neither took advantage of their influence nor realized the extent of it. They still don't. Giovanni wants to take over the world economy. Me...I just want to take over. And if I had control of his militia I could do far more... Giovanni and Rose already loathe each other. I want to keep them at each other's throats. When the two behemoths eliminate each other, then I get to be king. You, Archer Verdi," Cade emphasized at last, "will help me finish the mafia war Giovanni believed he'd ended twenty years ago. The first step is eliminating Giovanni and his blood heirs."</p>

<p>"I'll never go against my godfather," snapped Archer. "Least of all to help a Skuntank like you."</p>

<p>"You have every reason to assist me," replied Cade. "You've always believed not to let past sacrifices go to waste. The glory of your syndicate hangs in the balance; Giovanni will destroy everything you've worked for. Because of that...you want to rule Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"No I don't."</p>

<p>Espeon unleashed another Zap Cannon. Fire and electricity scorched Archer, yet despite his outcries he remained defiant.</p>

<p>"...I will never go against Giovanni!"</p><hr />

<p>Hours went by. For Archer it was ceaseless.</p>

<p>It wore him down steadily, and where others might have repudiated their tormentor's demands outright, his own doubts began to mingle with them and leant their own peculiar credence.</p>

<p>Some part of him still clung to the idea he'd not been abandoned here. He imagined Team Rocket's soldiers bursting in, killing Cade, and pulling him from this torture chamber. Then after a brief recovery he'd be in Giovanni's office talking with his godfather about everything that happened. He'd be told how proud they were of his efforts to hold firm. How it meant something. How they'd never given up on him...</p>

<p>"You want to rule Team Rocket."</p>

<p>Archer was exhausted. It was all a dream, and dreams were nonsensical hallucinations. He wanted it to end already; he wanted the torture to stop one way or the other. Giovanni wasn't coming to the rescue, no one from Team Rocket was being sent to save him, they'd all left him for dead. With a single, weary sigh Archer at last gave in:</p>

<p>"Yes...I want to rule Team Rocket."</p>

<p>Cade glanced at Espeon, which gave a twitch of its ear – and then motioned again towards Archer.</p>

<p>This time Archer was completely unprepared. Agony burned through his body, tearing him into an excruciating spasm, and his mind raced in attempts to grasp at reason.</p>

<p>As if he'd asked the question aloud, Cade answered calmly. "You don't believe it yet."</p>

<p>Comprehension came over Archer with a pall. He stared dumbstruck at Cade, who looked darkly amused.</p>

<p>"Espeon can read your mind, remember? You'll either have to become very clever at hiding your thoughts or give in of your own volition. And I assure you, pain will eventually rule out the former."</p>

<p>"But how can I believe it?" Archer implored.</p>

<p>He got no answer, save for more pain. Now the true horror of his ordeal began. If compliance was not sufficient, then what was the way out? He couldn't force himself to accept a fallacy.</p>

<p>"What an embarrassment. Giovanni can see you're weak, and weakness is useless in our line of business." Cade smirked. "You don't even have the balls to take charge of the organization when you see your dear godfather failing. No wonder he tosses you aside to play babysitter to their cadets."</p>

<p>Cade saw the small wince in Archer's features. He'd hit a nerve with that one. He'd remember and return to it later.</p>

<p>"Admit that you want to rule Team Rocket," reiterated Cade.</p>

<p>Archer <i>tried</i> to believe it. It seemed shameful at first, but his strangely suppressed emotions were swiftly pacified by self-delusion. There was a sense of surprising freedom in not having to fight against what was demanded.</p>

<p>Cade glanced at Espeon, which twitched its tail, and turned back towards Archer with dissatisfaction. "You're trying, which is an improvement. You still have to want to."</p>

<p>"I swear I want to!"</p>

<p>He'd foolishly gambled the lie, and unsurprisingly was met with the immediate attack of Espeon. Fiery pain slashed through him brutally like a knife. He was broiling alive. Smoke twirled at the edges of his sight; he could no longer tell if it was from lightheadedness, or the electricity, or both. It was mercy when he passed out.</p>

<p>Upon seeing Archer's body go limp, Cade tentatively placed a hand on his neck to check for a pulse. He found one; weak, and extremely rapid, but present.</p>

<p>He scowled and recalled Archer to the Poké Ball with the press of a button. He'd wanted to beat his prisoner up a little longer, but wasn't about to risk killing him yet.</p><hr />

<p>Balancing his mayoral duties with his supposed assistance of Cipher's activities – and the furtherance of his own – proved less taxing than Cade had first thought it'd be.</p>

<p>It was already past six when he sat down to eat dinner. It was a lavish meal, which he always tended towards in the evenings, with meat and wines and a centerpiece bowl of various berries imported from outside Orre. In the midst of this feast came an unanticipated telephone call from Silph.</p>

<p>Cade didn't let him get past more than a greeting. "Mr. Silph, I must commend your company on manufacturing such a flawless product. Your Poké Balls work as they should."</p>

<p>"The ones without the fail-safes?" remarked Silph, "I'm not going to ask what you caught."</p>

<p>Cade skirted the implicit question. "A highly regulated species, one proving quite difficult to tame."</p>

<p>"That reminds me of a chat I had with Lance from the Elite Four," Silph remarked amicably. "He trains dragons; they're supposed to be one of the hardest beasts to handle. He says once the Pokémon realizes you feed it, getting it to respond to you is easy."</p>

<p>"...shit, I think I forgot to feed him."</p>

<p>"Well, there you go. The critter's probably just hungry. Listen, Cade, the reason I called was about Giovanni," Silph changed the topic. "Are you sure your people can prevent him from doing something...er...dramatic?"</p>

<p>"You're still worried about Giovanni? I told you he's inconsequential," Cade dismissed.</p>

<p>"He knows about our business deal."</p>

<p>"Does he know about me?"</p>

<p>"Um...no."</p>

<p>"Well then, how can he know about <i>our</i> business deal?"</p>

<p>"He knows Silph Co. is sending illegally modified Poké Balls to Orre. Cade, that's felony-level contraband; those Poké Balls I'm selling you could even be used to trap human beings."</p>

<p>Cade was glad Silph was on the phone and not face-to-face; he thought his smile at that remark would have been far too revealing. "Mr. Silph, you have nothing to worry about, as I've said. Now, I think I ought to feed my new Pokémon, and you have to get your company's next Poké Ball shipment ready. You can expect the bank transfer as usual." He hung up, cutting off Silph's protest.</p><hr />

<p>Archer woke to find himself back in the warm twilight and peaceful solitude of the Poké Ball. After what he'd been through, he was glad to be in here as opposed to being tortured outside. He didn't know how much more suffering he could take.</p>

<p>His heart beat so strongly that it seemed his body shook in response, and he could still taste a tang of blood on the side of his lip from where the guards had punched him. Hunger and thirst had already reached the point where it made the act of moving an agony in itself. Archer didn't want to move anyway. He wanted to rest quietly and pretend he could will away his nightmarish predicament.</p>

<p>He lay there for a long time. He didn't even bother to stand when he saw the clasp unlock; he only shuddered at the thought of what awaited him. As a result, he emerged lying on the floor.</p>

<p>"Get up," ordered Cade.</p>

<p>Archer forced himself to at least sit, though his body shrieked for him to stay reposed. As usual he was in the dimly-lit office with the columns where they conducted their interrogations; Cade stood facing him, with Espeon unfailingly by his side, and guards, but surprisingly no one sprang to restrain him in any way. "You finally decided to let me out of my captivity?" he mustered a confrontation.</p>

<p>"Well just so you see I'm not completely heartless I thought you might need some food and relief," Cade replied.</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers, and one of his men left the room and returned quickly with a tray that held a piece of bread. It was ceremoniously held out in front of Archer and his hunger was so intense that he grabbed hold of it without any prompting.</p>

<p>More desperate than he admitted to himself, he scarfed down the bread only to flinch at immediate stabbing inside his mouth, bad enough to cause him to halt eating till the pain reduced. Apparently the cut was worse than he'd thought.</p>

<p>"Consider yourself fed," stated Cade, "now you need a drink."</p>

<p>He took a flask that was on the desk and a glass from the drawer; promptly filling it to the brim...with water. He handed it to Archer.</p>

<p>The glass of water was heavy, but he held it like a precious possession that could be snatched away from him; he was genuinely worried someone might. It was one of those crystalline drinking vessels carved with a vintage design, which in surroundings not so dark as these would have captured light like a jewel. <i>If it would only reflect that same brilliance here,</i> Archer thought wistfully. He couldn't tell what the design represented. Vines of flowers? Windswept snowflakes?</p>

<p>Archer drank the water. The freshness cooled his mouth and throat and after he had swallowed some of it, Cade spoke up again.</p>

<p>"You're starting to look a little unkempt too. You'll be allowed to shave under supervision."</p>

<p>Snapping his fingers again, two guards took him by the arms and led him to a restroom sink and mirror that was fully equipped with shaving cream and razors. The guards stood on either side of him, aiming guns at his head. "Proceed with it," one of them ordered.</p>

<p>Archer shaved his face. When he was done, he was escorted back to Cade.</p>

<p>"Do you see how far easier it is for you if you cooperate?" Cade asked.</p>

<p>Archer gave him a sideways wary glance, like a feral Pokémon being fed by a strange human. Cade shrewdly added, "I don't want to harm you. I want to teach you."</p>

<p>"Is that why you put me through those torture sessions?"</p>

<p>"They're not torture sessions," corrected Cade, "they're training sessions."</p>

<p>"It seems torturous," Archer couldn't resist saying. "Not to mention how you're locking me in a Poké Ball."</p>

<p>"Poké Balls aren't inherently inhumane, no more than any kind of animal enclosure would be."</p>

<p><i>That...was true,</i> thought Archer. Confusion muddled the distinction between being a human versus an animal and the rights accorded each. For a moment the cage seemed innocuous. Cade would attempt to cultivate that.</p>

<p>"If anything you should be happy you have a chance to rest from your injuries," he added.</p>

<p>"I'm injured because you injured me," Archer pointed out.</p>

<p>"You injured yourself, through your own disobedience," Cade reprimanded.</p>

<p>Archer didn't answer. What was the point in disputing it? To be punished yet again?</p>

<p>"You need to accept your training faster instead of self-centering on what resulted from your own stupid mistakes. You fainted. So what?" Cade went on, "You're not badly wounded."</p>

<p>Maybe if he had access to adequate medical treatment, Archer could agree to that latter statement. He didn't think he had any broken bones or similar injuries that could not be healed with a mere Potion spray; however, without access to any here Archer worried about infection, generally a non-issue in the modern era considering their world's advanced medicine. He noticed Espeon glance at Cade, and realized the thought had been inadvertently communicated when his captor added:</p>

<p>"Medical care? That's entirely valid. All I want is for you to learn, and if you make a genuine effort, I'll see that you get medical care after. That's not so difficult, is it?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to learn." Up to a point, Archer meant it.</p>

<p>It was a gradual, insidious process. Small concessions here and there didn't matter in the long run, if it allowed him to survive; right? He wasn't compromising anything if he submitted sometimes to his captor.</p>

<p>"And now, you're going back in the Poké Ball."</p>

<p>Archer didn't argue the point and let himself be recalled.</p>

<p>He did feel a little better. At least the bread had quelled some of his hunger, and he guessed there would be no further interrogations till tomorrow – whenever tomorrow was, because he could not tell time here at all. He didn't think much of Cade's assurance of medical care.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes later a wave of energy washed through the walls, surprising Archer, but when it engulfed him he found it to be tranquilizing. As he watched, the bruises and burns on his body faded away, and even the pain from the cut on his lip vanished.</p>

<p><i>...Heal Pulse?</i> Archer recognized the effects from having seen Pokémon such as Chansey and Audino use it, but never had he witnessed the energy in such a tidal wave.</p>

<p>When the healing energy receded, a familiar chime rang out, and it was only at that point Archer realized he'd been put through the restoring device commonly used in Pokémon Centers.</p><hr />

<p>Judging from the amount of times he'd been fed, and his frequency of shaving, and even presuming he was not granted these privileges often – he already viewed them as privileges; they were only permitted him depending on how well he responded to Cade's trials after all – Archer estimated he had been captive for over a week.</p>

<p>One of the few entertainments available to him within the Poké Ball remained listening to the outer world and trying to guess what was going on around him. He was able to tell Cade carried the Poké Ball around like any other, except for moments when he placed them aside in what Archer thought sounded like a desk drawer. One day, however, he heard something familiar.</p>

<p>It sounded like Houndoom.</p>

<p>His curiosity suddenly returned sweeping emotion – indisputable dread. His Pokémon sounded in distress. He heard Houndoom yelp, and when its yelp turned into howls Archer sprang to tug urgently at the lock. He knew by now it wouldn't budge, but a sense of fear for his pet's life had now overcome him.</p>

<p>The howls receded ominously to whimpers.</p>

<p>It felt like hours later when Archer was sent out to face Cade again. Espeon sat at his captor's heels as businesslike and attentive as ever, and numerous guards surrounded them.</p>

<p>"What did you do to my Pokémon?" Archer pursued.</p>

<p>"The same thing I did to you," Cade replied, "which I intend to do <i>again</i>."</p>

<p>Archer didn't understand, but he realized he wasn't in the typical interrogation room. Instead he was in a wide chamber, with a control panel overlooking a metal table and a large laser of some sort attached to the ceiling. There was something vaguely familiar about the room; Archer couldn't place it, but it made something within him cower.</p>

<p>Cade went on with no shortage of contempt, "I succeeded with Houndoom far faster than the progress I'm making with you. You're disappointing me tremendously; I've had at this charade long enough already, so maybe you need to be put through the process a second round. If you don't survive this time, there's no sense chasing an impossibility."</p>

<p>It was when Archer saw the sadistic gleam in his eyes, not so different from his own at a time long ago, that he became convinced he was truly going to be killed.</p>

<p>When the guards forced him to the metal table, and restrained him tightly upon it, his mind was awhirl in still-shocked emotionlessness. Fleeting thoughts of former colleagues, and Giovanni, and a young trainer with an Eevee. Reminiscences of happier moments that never occurred. As irrelevantly, his thoughts centered back on the drinking glass...the intricate design etched on it, unique and beautiful and fragile.</p>

<p>The sight of the laser pointed at his forehead brought back the twinge of a subconscious memory, forgotten in the depths of a trauma. And suddenly all his distractions and the last of his hopes withered away in the terror of recollection.</p>

<p>"No... stop—<i>don't</i>!"</p>

<p>The exclamation halted everything, save for his heart throbbing painfully, and the world still whirling around him in unrelenting, nauseating vertigo. He fought to form words, and when he successfully did they came out half-stammered and tremulous.</p>

<p>"I can't take the pain any more. Please, I..." His voice trailed away as he gazed up at his tormentor, who was leering down as he leant over him. Archer's eyes were wide and pleading, blue pools filled with fear.</p>

<p>"I'll do any...anything you want."</p>

<p>Cade hesitated, as if considering the request, and then:</p>

<p>"Will you do what I want to stop the pain, or because you want to obey me?"</p>

<p>Archer's gaze flickered involuntarily to Espeon and back to Cade; the mayor regarded him steadily with an expectant look. He had the distinct feeling that no matter what he replied, it would be met with punishment. Weary, and seeing no solution, he relented.</p>

<p>"To stop the pain," he said feebly.</p>

<p>He fully expected to be shocked yet again, either by Espeon or the dreaded energy ray. To his surprise, Cade recalled Espeon.</p>

<p>"Very good. You're learning to be honest."</p>

<p>All at once his emotions swamped him, as if they had been held back by a wall. Archer was shivering uncontrollably and no longer caring if he looked as piteous as he felt. He did not realize when his restraints were loosened, and only vaguely registered when Cade lay a hand on his shoulder almost soothingly. "Would you like a drink of water? You've earned the privilege."</p>

<p>Archer glanced up at him with gratitude. He was being granted a small kindness, and longing for any sort of compassion had finally made him willing to debase himself for it.</p>

<p>When the crystalline cup with the cold water was brought, Archer reached for it, yet his grasp was weak.</p>

<p>The glass slipped from his fingers and shattered to the floor.</p><hr />

<p>Archer was docile now.</p>

<p>Maybe it was beyond self-preservation after all. If Cade held sway over his life and death and the quality thereof, it was only natural Archer should to try to appease him. He realized he <i>wanted</i> to be in Cade's good graces. He wanted kind treatment in the same way he wanted Team Rocket to return to its stolen greatness, even if it meant he'd have to step up to accomplish that himself.</p>

<p>He took his captivity as inevitable. It had been some time he ceased to feel those rushes of fear at the interrogations, and instead cemented his emotionless calm. He would do what he was told.</p>

<p>And really, why wouldn't he want to do as he was told? All he had to do was genuinely want to please.</p>

<p>He became faster at responding to Cade's hand signals. They were directives of when and where and how to act, in lieu of verbal commands. Disobedience was out of the question. Everything he was told made perfect sense now: Giovanni was unwittingly destroying his own organization, and Archer's abandonment by his former colleagues here had helped him see the state of Team Rocket for what it was. Cade only wanted to help him attain his rightful position, to save Team Rocket and help the syndicate regain its former glory before it was too late. Of course he'd have to accept Cade's guidance; any illogic in <i>that</i> was disregarded.</p>

<p>When the trials were over sometimes he'd be praised, and praise usually came with reward. He was fed more frequently now, with hearty meals substituting the bread he'd been given sparingly. The more compliant he was, the more allowances were extended him.</p>

<p>Frequently the Poké Ball was now left unlocked from the outside, allowing Archer to enter and exit at will, but he knew he was expected to remain when recalled and didn't fight it. Nor did he resent when it was locked. He entertained himself with the idea he was like a genie in a lamp; of course the genie must obey its master. Entirely neutral about his state of affairs, Archer began to accept his own subservience willingly like a pleasant dichotomy.</p>

<p>According to Cade, he'd made a great improvement. Houndoom – having already been "converted" – would be returned to him, and he might even be granted a second Shadow Pokémon considering how well he was doing. Archer would have to give them back to Cade whenever he was recalled, since a Poké Ball could not be nested within another Poké Ball, but he'd otherwise have use of his Pokémon when the time came to make their strike against Giovanni.</p>

<p>The final trial was not even announced as such, and came at the end of one of the routine drills; it was unexpected but taken with nonchalance by Archer, and wholly unplanned for by Cade. Instead of recalling his prisoner, Cade merely held out the Poké Ball. Archer lightly reached out and tapped the button, allowing the red glow of light to wash over him as he vanished into the capsule.</p>

<p>Cade no longer tried to hide his glee as he locked the Poké Ball and deposited it in the pocket of his jacket.</p>

<p>It was not only possible. It had been done. He had done it.</p>

<p>No sooner did Delia Ketchum hear about the encounter her son Ash had with Team Rocket's boss did she resolve to travel to Celadon City. She left in a great hurry and told no one her intent, not even Professor Oak, and arrived at Celadon that morning.</p>

<p>Delia walked up to the receptionist on the ground floor of Rocket Enterprises.</p>

<p>"May I help you?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"I need to speak with Mr. Giovanni Delavita please," replied Delia, "Which floor is he on?"</p>

<p>"Well, no one is allowed upstairs without an appointment..."</p>

<p>Delia interrupted her, "Please call him and tell him Delia is here and wants to speak with him."</p>

<p>"Ma'am... what is the nature of your visit."</p>

<p>"It is a personal matter. Please call him and let him know I am here."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied the receptionist doubtfully.</p>

<p>She picked up the phone, and pushed a button. Immediately, Team Rocket guards came out of doors that were surrounding the area of the lobby.</p>

<p>"This woman is trying to see the boss," the receptionist told them. "She hasn't stated why."</p>

<p>A very tall guard with a mean face approached Delia and said, "Mr. Delavita cannot be disturbed. I suggest you..."</p>

<p>Delia spoke over him in a loud voice and looked at him straight in the eyes, "Let me give you a bit of advice...He will be very angry if he finds out that I was here and was forbidden to see him! ...I am guessing you have seen him angry?"</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" A voice sounded behind them. It was Jessie, and with her were James and their tagalong Meowth walking into the lobby.</p>

<p>"This woman..." the guard began.</p>

<p>"We heard it," said James.</p>

<p>"Let her pass," ordered Jessie, "or the boss will declare you an enemy."</p>

<p>The guards all looked at each other nervously and backed off.</p>

<p>Delia looked at the receptionist, who was visibly frightened and said, "My name is Delia Ketchum. Don't forget it."</p>

<p>At this point Jessie and James spoke up.</p>

<p>"Miss, we will be happy to escort you to our boss' office," said James.</p>

<p>"It's in the penthouse...top floor," added Jessie.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>They led her to the elevator, up to the top floor, and escorted her to the doorway of Giovanni's office. The door was open, and Giovanni was talking with his large cat, Persian.</p>

<p>"Maybe we ought to let Mr. Rose think over what happened before we try anything else...I don't know. What do you think...?"</p>

<p>Persian replied with a series of meows, and Giovanni listened intently and nodded once or twice. The dialogue Giovanni was having with Persian was two-way; Delia smiled in reminiscence.</p>

<p>"You still understand Persian," she said.</p>

<p>The boss of Team Rocket glanced up suddenly and, the moment her eyes met his, returned her smile.</p>

<p>Jessie and James knew this was their cue to leave. They turned and walked away to the elevator, hand in hand, with Meowth chasing after them.</p>

<p>"Persian acts as my counsellor," Giovanni explained. "Pokémon are more trustworthy than people."</p>

<p>"Yet you like to say Pokémon are just tools for business."</p>

<p>"Except for Persian. Persian is more than that. He's part of the family."</p>

<p>Delia still stood at the doorway, and Giovanni suddenly realized it.</p>

<p>"<i>Perdonami amore mio</i>!" he apologized, "I haven't asked you in! I'm so eager to speak with you."</p>

<p>He stood up and quickly walked over; putting his hand on her back, he guided her over to an armchair gesturing to it for her to sit, which she did.</p>

<p>"Gio, there is something I need you to help me with..." Delia began.</p>

<p>"Anything." There was a ferocious absoluteness to the way Giovanni said it as he sat on the corner of his desk facing her, "What problem do you need to go away?"</p>

<p>"No Gio, it's nothing like that," she hurried to explain.</p>

<p>"I told you once that I'm here for you no matter what you need, and I still say that." Giovanni paused. "You know that I've always loved you."</p>

<p>She blinked with shared emotion. "I've always loved you too. Everything changed, Gio…even when we didn’t want it to."</p>

<p>He got up and taking her by the arms, pulled her gently out of the chair and hugged her close, kissing her cheek tenderly.</p>

<p>"It feels so good to have you in my arms again," murmured Giovanni, as he stroked her hair, "Delia, come back to me. We can start over..."</p>

<p>"Yes, Gio, I think the time is finally right for us...but I must talk to you about something. You might know by now," she said, lifting her eyes to look at him directly, "my son Ash has started on his trainer's journey."</p>

<p>"We've already met," Giovanni replied, "He seems to have made the unfortunate acquaintance of the two who escorted you here as well."</p>

<p>Dread seized her. "You can't let them harm him!"</p>

<p>"Delia..." began Giovanni.</p>

<p>"He's your son!" Delia finally exclaimed.</p>

<p>Giovanni stared at her.</p>

<p>"He's your son," Delia reiterated, feeling weary all of a sudden. "I haven't told him you're his father yet."</p>

<p>"Somehow, I always knew," he replied. "I figured you would address it when the time was right."</p>

<p>They were both silent for a while, and then Giovanni spoke again. "Delia, I would very much like for you to have lunch with me today."</p>

<p>"I'd like that," she answered.</p>

<p>He picked up the phone receiver on his desk and summoned his chauffeur who arrived within a short time. They went downstairs, crossed the lobby, and as they climbed into the limousine, Giovanni took Delia in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>Still holding her in his arms, he spoke with the driver. "Drive to Federico's and wait outside till we're finished."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>They drove for about fifteen minutes and arrived at the restaurant. As they went in, Giovanni was greeted happily by the head waiter. "Mr. Delavita, sir... So nice of you to come see us today."</p>

<p>"Hello, Tony... My usual table please."</p>

<p>The man led the way to a permanently reserved table at the back, where Giovanni pulled the chair out for Delia himself, as the waiter did for him.</p>

<p>It was a very elegant establishment with waiters wearing black and white uniforms and white silk gloves to serve the food. The tables were set with real silver utensils and the plates were all crystal. Flower bouquets adorned the tables, which the waiter retrieved when they were seated.</p>

<p>"This is a really nice place, Gio," Delia commented.</p>

<p>"Glad you like it, my dear. You deserve the best, and I intend to see you get it," he replied. At this point the waiter came and took their order.</p>

<p>"Bring a bottle of the best champagne you have, and two goblets," Giovanni ordered.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," answered the waiter, and left.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Giovanni then took Delia's hands in his and they looked into each other's eyes. Delia's heart skipped a beat, and Giovanni squeezed her hands a bit and said:</p>

<p>"Delia... I have never loved any woman as much as I love you. I ask you now what I planned to ask years ago... Delia, would you marry me?"</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears of joy, and she smiled. When she found her voice her reply was brief. "Yes, Giovanni... I will marry you."</p>

<p>He kissed her hands, "We shall go together to buy the engagement and wedding rings...you shall have whichever you want."</p>

<p>At this point, the waiter arrived with the champagne and glasses; he opened the cork, filled the two cups, and left anew.</p>

<p>Giovanni lifted his glass in a toast, "To our happiness."</p>

<p>"To our happiness," repeated Delia, clinking her glass to his.</p>

<p>Soon, their lunch was served and as they ate they talked about how to break the news to Ash.</p>

<p>"Imagine, Gio!" Delia exclaimed, "I first tell him you are his father, and then tell him that we're getting married."</p>

<p>Giovanni shrugged his shoulders, "<i>L'amore e dolce, cara mia</i>. He's not a child anymore. He'll understand."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right."</p>

<p>"Why don't you both come to the mansion tomorrow for dinner," Giovanni said.</p>

<p>"All right. Then that's when I'll tell him about us."</p>

<p>They finished their meal, returned to the limousine and Giovanni dropped Delia off at her home, with a kiss and a promise to call her that evening. Delia went into the house and watched from her window as the car drove off.</p>

<p>Her world was finally becoming truly joyful.</p><hr />

<p>Ash returned to Lavender Town with the Cubone, which he took to the Pokemon Center. There it was reunited with its mother the Marowak. Content that he at least had helped these Pokémon, he and Pikachu headed on their way.</p>

<p>They were now en route to their next gym battle. That happened to be in Fuchsia City, which was a long way from here. Still, after the easy way in which Ash won against the Celadon gym, his spirits were bolstered and the loss against the Vermillion gym – which he still had to return to challenge – was put out of his mind. Even the annoyance of not being able to access Saffron City was momentarily pushed aside – he'd get to it eventually but it was a future problem.</p>

<p>From Celadon, the quickest way was a long street heading towards Fuchsia with an adjoining bicycle path sloping downwards. It was known as Cycling Road. However, Ash did not have a bicycle. He had an idea to buy one back at Cerulean City, but the prices were exorbitant and he airily declared to Pikachu that before spending half a fortune on a bike he'd sooner walk the whole way. That was being put to practice now. With no way onto the shortcut of Cycling Road, he was forced to take the longer pedestrian path of route 17 called Pokémon Road, and that promised to be no shorter than a full two-week's trek through forest trails and meadowland. Signs at the beginning of the route warned hikers to pack accordingly.</p>

<p>Ash made the best of it, however. The route had beautiful foliage especially now in autumn, and berry trees grew in abundance alongside the road. He also knew this was one of the few areas in the Kanto region where wild horses known as Ponyta and Rapidash could be found, and after three days of walking with no town in sight he made up his mind that if he should happen across one he would make a concerted effort to catch it and ride the rest of the way to Fuchsia.</p>

<p>That afternoon they made camp in a thicket clearing not far from the main trail. While Ash chopped wood for the campfire, Pikachu had found an acorn and began batting it around playfully; when Ash finally settled down to cook, Pikachu scampered over and sat beside him.</p>

<p>He had stocked up before leaving Celadon. He was roasting some sausages for himself, and had kibble for Pikachu. That said out here it was easy to live off the land. Pikachu in particular loved the wildness of the route; occasionally it would dart into the bracken and emerge with berries to share.</p>

<p>Rustling bushes made Ash glance up, distracting him briefly from the food, and as he watched a Pokémon lifted its head from the bracken.</p>

<p>It was an Eevee.</p>

<p>Wild Eevee were exceptionally rare in these parts. Ash observed it without making any sudden movements. Sniffing the air, the animal padded towards the campfire and the meat roasting over it.</p>

<p>The Eevee snatched a sausage.</p>

<p>"You're hungry, I see," Ash said.</p>

<p>The Eevee squeaked as a reply, and was tame enough that it allowed him to pet it. "You can't be a wild Pokémon, can you?" Ash surmised.</p>

<p>His question was answered immediately by a female voice calling through the trees:</p>

<p>"Eevee...! Where are you?"</p>

<p>She looked about his age, with teal hair picked up into two ponytails and bright blue eyes. The moment she saw them, she deduced what had happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry! Did Eevee steal some of your food?" she asked apologetically.</p>

<p>"No, we're happy to share," smiled Ash. Pikachu, sitting beside him, gave an equally friendly chirp.</p>

<p>"My name's Ash."</p>

<p>"My name's Kris," she responded gathering Eevee into her arms.</p>

<p>"Are you also challenging the Pokémon League?"</p>

<p>"Well, sort of. I'd actually been gathering badges from the Johto region. But I got sidetracked."</p>

<p>She looked sad about an unspoken memory, but then shook it off when Ash asked, "Would you like to join us? We've got plenty of food here, enough to share."</p>

<p>"Well..." Kris started to say, hesitant, but Eevee gave a cheery cry and gave a little hop out of her grasp to join Pikachu beside the campfire. She smiled. "I guess it won't do any harm."</p>

<p>Over the meal, Ash and Kris chatted about their respective voyages. "I figured I'd travel around Kanto for a while and take in the sights," Kris told him. "Autumn is such a pretty season, don't you think? So I decided to take the long way to Fuchsia City to see the zoo."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah that's right, Fuchsia City has the Safari Zone. I've never been there," Ash remarked. "We're heading to challenge the gym. I know they specialize in poison types, so I probably should stop by the mart before going there and stock up on Antidotes."</p>

<p>"You could also get a bunch of Pecha berries," Kris said. "I saw a grove of them down the trail. Pecha berries are a natural antidote against attacks from most poison type Pokémon."</p>

<p>Pikachu gave a chirp, and Eevee replied with its own cry. Both Ash and Kris laughed, and then glanced at each other in fair surprise.</p>

<p>"You understand your Pokémon too?"</p>

<p>Yes!" Kris exclaimed, "I guess when we treat our Pokémon like family we end up so bonded that we understand their language."</p>

<p>"That's true," Ash nodded his head.</p>

<p>They were quiet for a while, mulling their thoughts, and then Ash spoke up, "Since we're both heading in the direction of Fuschia City, maybe we could walk along together?"</p>

<p>It was phrased as a question but Kris detected wishful thinking on Ash's part, almost a hidden shyness.</p>

<p>"Sure," she smiled, "Thats a great idea!"</p><hr />

<p>After that the two of them journeyed the rest of the way. They found in each other ideal travelling companions, and Pikachu and Eevee enjoyed playing and occasionally sparring with each other too.</p>

<p>They had made camp for the night when Eevee nudged Kris awake.</p>

<p>"...hmm? Eevee? What's wrong?" Kris asked drowsily.</p>

<p>Ash and Pikachu were fast asleep, and the forest was resolutely peaceful. The faint hooting of a Noctowl competed with the nighttime ballad of Kricketune.</p>

<p>Eevee was staring intently at the bracken. As Kris watched, she saw the sudden gleam of a Pokémon's eyes behind the leaves and – before she could do anything – the swish of a Meowth's tail.</p>

<p>Suddenly realizing who was there, and being cautious not to wake Ash, Kris stepped lightly over to the bracken and behind a large tree.</p>

<p>She found who she expected to find: Jessie, James, and Meowth.</p>

<p>"Hi Kris," purred Meowth nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Did Giovanni send you to keep an eye on me and make sure I don't do something reckless?" Kris asked with a tinge of affront.</p>

<p>"Shh! Keep your voice down!" Jessie said.</p>

<p>"The boss doesn't even know we're here," James told her honestly.</p>

<p>Kris blinked. "Then...?"</p>

<p>"Quick question, does the twerp still have his Pikachu out of its Poké Ball?" asked Jessie, her eyes darting towards the campsite.</p>

<p>"Ash?" Kris echoed, perplexed. "Yeah, I don't think he ever puts Pikachu in its Poké Ball."</p>

<p>Jessie grinned. "Perfect."</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Kris.</p>

<p>"Can't tell you. It's top secret."</p>

<p>"And our secret tops them all," James chimed in.</p>

<p>"Top cats only," purred Meowth.</p>

<p>"Whatever. Look as long as I'm not in trouble with the boss or anything."</p>

<p>Meowth gave a yowl. "You travelling with the twerp now?"</p>

<p>"I figured, why not? At least until I reach Fuchsia City," she added, "It takes my mind off things."</p>

<p>"Well, stay out of the way when we get involved," Jessie replied. "Trust me, you'll know when."</p>

<p>Kris hesitated. "You're planning a hit?"</p>

<p>"More like a heist."</p>

<p>"We want his Pikachu," James admitted.</p>

<p>Jessie elbowed him sharply. "Way to spill our secret, James."</p>

<p>"His <i>Pikachu</i>? What's so special about his Pikachu? You know they're a dime a dozen out in Viridian Forest."</p>

<p>"It's the principle of the thing. We don't want any Pikachu; we want the twerp's Pikachu. You're still a rookie recruit, Kris. You have time to learn."</p>

<p>"Just keep quiet around that twerp and pretend we never let it slip about our Pikachu pilfering," James added.</p>

<p>Meowth was far less oblique, bearing his fangs in a hiss. "If you tell him you're a snitch and a traitor."</p>

<p>"I'm no snitch or traitor," Kris answered. "Team Rocket has my loyalty, you know that."</p>

<p>Satisfied with her response, they disappeared into the bracken. Kris shot them a dubious look as she returned to where Ash and the Pokémon were.</p>

<p>The trees were already aflame in autumn's maturity, their blazing shades of red and gold intermingling with the fickle light-green of summer's fading youth. It was one of those bright fall afternoons when the sun's warmth and brilliance played amidst cold breezes and infrequently brought leaves down in a cascade, where the day's insistence of dragging on compensated through outward beauty, and neither the splendour of the foliage nor the peace of routine failed to belie the many schemes about to be set in motion.</p>

<p>Waylaying their enemies was Team Rocket's favorite attack strategy, or at least the favored strategy of Jessie and James. It gave them the chance to scout out a battle site as well as plan the best type of ambuscade. They decided to keep to something tried and true for Ash, which would allow them to see his aghast reaction when they pounced – just out of gleeful revenge.</p>

<p>Meowth had gone off who-knew-where again and returned as they were finishing their insidious set-up.</p>

<p>"<i>Another</i> pitfall trap?" hissed Meowth, clearly unimpressed as he flattened his ears at it. "Don't you two knuckleheads remember what happened last time we did that?"</p>

<p>"Didn't we succeed at our mission?" asked James airily, as they dragged branches to cover the ditch.</p>

<p>Meowth refreshed their memory with a growl. "You fell into your own trap. Both of you."</p>

<p>"This time is different," James purported.</p>

<p>"Yeah Meowth – who says we don't learn from our mistakes?" insisted Jessie. "Don't you think we're smarter than that?"</p>

<p>The cat did not answer this and merely stared at them with his ears still flat.</p>

<p>"Someone's coming! Let's hide," said Jessie, and they all leapt into the bushes.</p>

<p>Strolling down the forest path were none other than their targets – the "twerp" with the Pikachu prize. With him was none other than Kris.</p>

<p>Ash and Kris were animately discussing something as they walked by, and James and Jessie instinctively crouched lower behind the cloak of bracken.</p>

<p>Ash was complaining. "We're running late damn it. We should be farther along than we are!"</p>

<p>"It'll work out...stop worrying so much!" responded Kris.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Team Rocket trio was assessing the situation.</p>

<p>"They're standing right on top of the hole; why the fuck don't they fall in?" hissed Meowth.</p>

<p>"James, you reinforced it too much," remarked Jessie with a tinge of accusation.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> reinforced it too much?" James countered.</p>

<p>"Quit your yakking before they hear us!" screeched Meowth.</p>

<p>Ash, Kris, and even Pikachu however were oblivious to the trio and continued talking. The Pikachu chimed in with a squeak.</p>

<p>"See that?!" Kris said, "even Pikachu says you are a worrier."</p>

<p>"Since when do you understand Pikachu?" Ash countered.</p>

<p>"Didn't I translate it right?" Kris demanded.</p>

<p>Ash scowled at her, but reluctantly grumbled, "You translated it right."</p>

<p>Back behind the bushes, the trio persisted with their analysis of the work at hand.</p>

<p>"We don't have a problem," James assured, "At least we planted those firecrackers around the edge of the pit."</p>

<p>"When did we do that?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"When you were touching up your lipstick Jessie," he teased.</p>

<p>"Well...beauty comes first," she said in a similarly coquettish way.</p>

<p>"All we've got to do is press this button," James added, revealing a small remote control. "This sets off the fireworks..."</p>

<p>Meowth's eyes lit up. "...and down goes the prey!" the cat meowed excitedly. "Push it!"</p>

<p>"...later," said James. Meowth flattened his ears again.</p>

<p>"Let's just relax, and enjoy it all," Kris said.</p>

<p>Ash sighed, "I guess you're right Kris."</p>

<p>Hidden behind the bushes, Jessie and James were watching with riveted frustration.</p>

<p>Meowth bared fangs. "Press the damn button!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," James objected.</p>

<p>"We need to wait for the right moment." Jessie remarked.</p>

<p>"Gimme that button," hissed Meowth, outstretching a paw.</p>

<p>"No, Meowth," James said indifferently, lifting the remote away from the cat."</p>

<p>" They're over the fucking pit. Push the button already!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Meowth," dismissed Jessie, "if they step away we'll just follow and hit them over the head the old fashioned way."</p>

<p>"Can't believe you two, watching this stupid conversation like a damn soap opera."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ash and Kris had sat down to rest and had quieted down.</p>

<p>"I think we should get going," Ash remarked, "I want to get to town before evening sets in."</p>

<p>"You're right" Kris agreed, "I'm ready," she added getting up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Team Rocket trio had had enough.</p>

<p>"So, are we all in agreement the time is now?" said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Let's go!" affirmed James.</p>

<p>"Yeah. <i>Please</i> push the button," replied Meowth emphatically.</p>

<p>In a swift motion, they did.</p>

<p>Suddenly firecrackers exploded in a circle about the ground, and with a unified cry of shock Kris leapt narrowly back while Ash and Pikachu fell into the trap.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of gleeful triumph, Jessie and James sprang to the edge of the pit. They could see Ash scrambling amidst the branches at the bottom of the ditch, and he could not regain his footing before Pikachu was swept up into a net.</p>

<p>"Give back Pikachu, you thieves!" exclaimed Ash.</p>

<p>"Nice doing business with you, twerp," sneered Jessie as she walked away with the captive Pikachu.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you oughta consider yourself lucky!" Meowth purred, padding after her.</p>

<p>"<i>Lucky</i>?" Ash could barely believe the assertion.</p>

<p>"We're letting you live," explained James snidely, tossing the rose into the ditch towards them. Ash caught it by the stem, narrowly missing the thorns, as James strolled after his companions.</p>

<p>"You're not getting away with this, Team Rocket!" Ash shouted after them.</p>

<p>Above, Kris now peered over the edge of the pit uncertainly at him, and Ash practically sprang with hope. "Kris, stop them!"</p>

<p>She looked rather embarrassed. "Ash, this might come as a shock to you..."</p>

<p>"They're getting away with Pikachu," he insisted desperately.</p>

<p>"I'm part of Team Rocket," confessed Kris.</p>

<p>Ash was left wordless for a long moment before finally uttering:</p>

<p>"You mean the whole thing was some kind of a sick setup?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know they were going to ambush you, honest!" exclaimed Kris.</p>

<p>He only stared at her, looking utterly betrayed. Kris sighed somewhat regretfully.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Ash," she said, and slipped out of sight.</p><hr />

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth strolled down the path to a clearing bend in the road by a cliff, feeling utterly pleased with themselves. Pikachu, to the contrary, was utterly annoyed. It let out sparks in a futile attempt to break free.</p>

<p>Jessie addressed the captive little creature. "Don't be so upset. You'll be much happier with the boss than that twerp. ...or at least <i>we'll</i> be much happier with our bonus," she acknowledged with a sly smile.</p>

<p>"I know we left the hot-air balloon parked around here somewhere," said James, searching the area.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a gust of wind, and they stopped as a large black helicopter landed lightly at a distance. As a group of lower-rank Team Rocket agents streamed out of the helicopter, their superior hopped down to meet the trio.</p>

<p>"Archer?" James remarked with surprise. "You're alive?"</p>

<p>"The boss sent me on a special assignment," said Archer.</p>

<p>"But he told everyone you were dead," added an astonished Jessie. "He even told us to hit Cipher back for it."</p>

<p>"Forewarned, forearmed," came Archer's easy reply, "It was necessary to keep things secret. I didn't expect you here at all." There was a tinge of something bitter in his tone, perhaps envy.</p>

<p>"Did he send you after this Pokémon?" Jessie asked, a little downcast at how their plan for a surprise gift was being upended.</p>

<p>"You can just give my subordinates the Pikachu. Where's its trainer?" Archer asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"We got him stuck in a ditch back there," responded James, pointing down the path as Jessie dutifully handed over their prize.</p>

<p>"That will make it easy. Good work...you won't be required anymore."</p>

<p>At a sharp signal his soldiers and their animals turned, weapons and fangs bared respectively, to encircle James, Jessie, and Meowth. The shock took a moment to sink in for them.</p>

<p>"The three of you have always been too soft – and too loyal to Giovanni. All that's left is to eliminate the don and his heir," Archer grinned, "and <i>I</i> will rule Team Rocket!"</p>

<p>"You two-timing traitor!" Jessie seethed.</p>

<p>Archer did not hesitate. "Shadow Wave – blast them off!" he called to Houndoom with a wave of his arm.</p>

<p>With a howl, a wave of energy shook outward from Houndoom in a concentrated tremor. Before Jessie or James or Meowth could react a jagged line splintered across the ground, pulling the earth upwards in a sudden explosive force, and suddenly the three of them were hurled into the sky.</p>

<p>They were barely able to register when their flight reversed into a plummeting descent over the precipice. Everything twirled about inconceivably in midair; the sky and the trees, the impaling rocks below, the buffeting rush of wind. Instantly James struck out with the whip to seize hold of one of the rocky outcrops, halting his fall just as he caught Jessie by the hand, and she managed to grab Meowth by the tail.</p>

<p>They held on tightly and crept carefully back to the cliff top, still trying to catch their breath. No one noticed them as they watched the scene unfold from behind a boulder: Archer's group forcing Ash into the helicopter at gunpoint before flying off.</p>

<p>James was first to speak, his mind still spinning. "What just happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but I'm sure if we ever have to do that again it'll be the death of us," Jessie replied wearily.</p>

<p>"You guys speaking for yourselves? I'm the one who got my tail yanked," Meowth hissed.</p>

<p>"Oh don't throw a hissy fit," countered Jessie, "you've got nine lives and you'd be one short if we'd all crash-landed."</p>

<p>To which Meowth gave an ornery <i>ffftt</i>.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," Jessie was saying, "<i>Archer</i> is a turncoat?"</p>

<p>"Giovanni's own godson," James thought it over briefly. "Jessie...what could he have meant by the don's heir? Giovanni doesn't have children as far as I know."</p>

<p>"I don't know, but Archer's got to pay for making us look like fools." Jessie clenched a fist.</p>

<p>Meowth chimed in with a caterwaul. "And we've gotta stop him before he gets Giovanni!"</p>

<p>"But first things first," James began, and Jessie finished his sentence adamantly, "...we're getting back our Pikachu!"</p>

<p>In the midst of this, Kris came running over to where they were. "I hid behind a tree back there," she said, halting before them, "I can't believe it; my brother's alive, but... Are you all okay?"</p>

<p>"We're fine, but Archer won't be for long if he's really planning to overthrow the boss," James said.</p>

<p>"Archer's not a traitor," Kris insisted, "I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Jessie squinted at her. "Well if he's not, then a ghost Pokémon possessed him. He's talking treason."</p>

<p>Meowth scratched behind an ear with a hind paw and gave his comments. "You two are jumping to conclusions. If those Cipher folks in Orre are able to produce Shadow Pokémon, maybe what we've got is a Shadow Human."</p>

<p>Jessie thought about this. "That's impossible."</p>

<p>"Is it, really?" considered James. "Jessie, supposed he's been brainwashed."</p>

<p>"Then he's a victim, not a traitor," reasoned Jessie. "Damn it, why can't things ever be straightforward?"</p>

<p>"We'll find out what's happened when we go after them. The people with Archer dropped this when they were pulling Ash out of the pitfall trap," Kris chimed in, showing them a crumpled handwritten note.</p>

<p>James took the note from her and the trio read it silently. "Kris," said Jessie, "we'll handle this. Go tell Giovanni what's going on."</p>

<p>Kris looked a little disappointed to not come along for the fight but she nodded briskly and, sending out Suicune, mounted the Pokémon's back and raced away. Jessie turned back to the note.</p>

<p>"So they're heading to the Kanto power plant."</p>

<h2 id="18">Chapter 18 - Trial by Fire</h2>

<p>Secluded in the farthest reaches of Route 10, along the narrow canyon river that snaked past Rock Tunnel and opened out into the ocean beyond Lavender Town, was the regional power plant that supplied electrical energy to the entirety of Kanto. It was hydro-powered, with a massive turbine run by a waterfall downriver. The untamed fields outside were a haven for electric Pokémon, and trainers would come by sporadically to hunt them. Other than this, the power plant was only frequented by those who worked there. At this hour, the employees at the main building had already gone home and not even a single security guard would be on duty that night.</p>

<p>Ash had never been to the area. It was such an out-of-the-way place, a veritable side quest; with his hurry to collect all gym badges in time for the League opening this year, Ash had figured it to be unnecessary for the furtherance of his career, though he did plan to make a trip there at some point when he felt less urgency. Never had he imagined he would be <i>brought</i> there, the hostage of a man whose aspirations he would soon come to learn.</p>

<p>Archer had collected a few favors of his own from certain regional officials and had gained access to a semi-abandoned annex separate from the main area of the power plant, so isolated not even Team Rocket were aware of its existence. It was of the days when the power plant had generated its energy from coal, mined from the depths of the Rock Tunnel, and had been the boiler-house for the furnaces.</p>

<p>Faceless concrete and the drab grey of cinder-blocks enclosed a wide, windowless factory. Imposing cylinders within towered two-stories high, the mills that had once pulverised coal powder to be fed to an even more ominous contrivance: a behemoth, rectangular pillar of metal that stood threateningly to conceal its purpose. Overhead metal walkways stretched through crisscrossed iron, old pipes, and concrete columns of ceiling supports. Even the ghost type Pokémon and Ratatta had forsaken dwelling here; this was how abandoned and lifeless the boiler-house was.</p>

<p>Ash did not dare speak at all. He was encircled by armed guards, his wrists bound by rope as he was pushed roughly down the path; meanwhile Pikachu was carried along still helplessly trapped in the net. Archer led the way through the concrete maze till they were brought before the giant metal pillar.</p>

<p>"Do you know what this is?" Archer asked mildly.</p>

<p>"No," answered Ash.</p>

<p>He proceeded to explain, maintaining the equable demeanour of instruction:</p>

<p>"This was the coal boiler. Boiler is a misnomer – it's a giant oven, which once heated water pipes running inside it to create steam to run the generator turbine. Nowadays it serves no purpose for the power plant, and the region intends to dismantle all this eventually."</p>

<p>He opened a latched metal viewing door on the side, and revealed not only the coal powder still blanketing the interior but also the switch beside the view-port. When he snapped it on, a ripple of whitish energy covered the opening like a screen, and dissipated as he switched it back off.</p>

<p>"This is similar to the technology used in Poké Balls," said Archer. "The barrier kept the heat from escaping, but allowed workers to visually ensure the blaze was at a proper level."</p>

<p>Ash was wondering where this was going, and starting to worry it might not be so irrelevant to his plight.</p>

<p>"The strength of the fire could be regulated by this dial," Archer went on, "and was ignited by a gas burner. Much like a conventional oven, but on a far larger scale. The burner doesn't work anymore."</p>

<p>He finished his explanation tersely, and looked expectantly at his Houndoom. As if following an unstated command, Houndoom shot a stream of fire into the open view-port, igniting the powdered coal bed into a carpet of flame.</p>

<p>Ash watched the fire shimmer, first to a snarling bonfire and then, at a mere twist of the dial, down to fine embers flickering and flitting like faeries within the coal sand.</p>

<p>"Technology is incredible, isn't it?" Archer commented genially, drawing Ash's attention back to him. He gave an approving nod to his subordinates. "I can handle this from here. You may leave."</p>

<p>The guards dipped their heads and exited dutifully, leaving the restrained Ash and Pikachu alone with Archer.</p>

<p>"Shadow Hold," Archer addressed Houndoom sharply, and with a violet glint of the dog's eyes, a shining energy washed over Ash. He flinched, but it settled quickly and dissipated from view, leaving his body weak.</p>

<p>Archer offered a brief explanation. "Shadow Hold is like the attack called Mean Look. In case you haven't fought many dark and ghost types, Mean Look prevents its target from escaping – more precisely, from moving more than a few paces. You're staying put."</p>

<p>Considering his hands were already tied behind his back, the need for added restraint perplexed Ash. He glanced from the flames to Houndoom; the fire's glow highlighted something strange about the Pokémon's features, which Ash realized all the Pokémon accompanying his captors shared. The creatures reacted with a dull obedience that toggled rapidly to sharp aggression, so different from most Pokémon Ash knew. Pikachu, still hopelessly ensnared, seemed unnerved by them.</p>

<p>Even Archer himself, Ash noticed, shared that expression of impassivity bordering on disdain, as if tainted by the remnants of some unknown trauma.</p>

<p>At that moment, another man joined them and stood observantly at a distance. When Archer glanced towards him, the newcomer gave a small nod.</p>

<p>"My name is Archer Verdi," said Archer, turning back towards Ash, "My overseer is Mayor Evice S. Cade."</p>

<p><i>'Overseer' is kind of an odd choice of word,</i> thought Ash. By now steadily growing concerns brought him courage to speak. "What does Team Rocket want with us?"</p>

<p>"Team Rocket?" Archer echoed. "They want whatever Giovanni wants. You are not a prisoner of Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"That's hard to believe," Ash replied, fidgeting against the ropes.</p>

<p>"As I said," Archer clarified coldly, "you are not a prisoner of Team Rocket. You are a prisoner of <i>mine</i>."</p>

<p>Ash looked at him in mute surprise.</p>

<p>"Those two clowns who set the trap for you...Jessie Scordato and James Marchesi...they were representatives of Team Rocket. I represent what Team Rocket will be," said Archer. "My goal is to take over the syndicate as its new don. And you, Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town, stand in my way."</p>

<p>"Look, I don't know what you mean. I've got no stake in this. Let me and Pikachu go."</p>

<p>"You have a very large stake in it. I don't appreciate being less than the majority shareholder of an enterprise."</p>

<p>"If you want to be leader of Team Rocket, go ahead. We don't have anything to do with it," said Ash. "If Pikachu and I..."</p>

<p>"You care a lot about Pikachu, don't you?" Archer interjected with observation.</p>

<p>Ash hesitated, and then the force of his apprehension wavered. No, he was imagining this; his mind was painting dark figments of fancy, probably having watched too many sensationalised gangster films or heard too many exaggerated tales of Team Rocket's misdeeds. There was no one so evil, so cruelly cold-hearted. So he answered with honesty:</p>

<p>"Pikachu's my childhood friend. I probably care about him more than I do myself."</p>

<p>Archer considered this thoughtfully but did not respond.</p>

<p>"Please let us go," Ash ventured again. "We haven't done anything to you."</p>

<p>Archer glanced from Ash to Pikachu. From where it was trapped in the net, the little animal gave an inoffensive squeak. "<i>Pikaaa</i>..."</p>

<p>"And someone so entirely worthless as a trainer," continued Archer, ignoring Ash's statement as he faced Pikachu, "with a Pokémon little more than a house-pet, appears from obscurity and cuts in line for the throne. Don't tell me you're crossing paths with Team Rocket by coincidence. There's no such thing. Destiny is already set, Ash Ketchum, and <i>I</i> am the one who will take over from Giovanni."</p>

<p>His eyes lifted briefly towards Cade; when Ash followed the motion he saw Cade give a hand signal, the gesture slight and swift and missable. Archer's eyes fixed again on Pikachu.</p>

<p>"You think you're strong enough to weave a different destiny?" added Archer calmly.</p>

<p>In a sudden motion Archer threw Pikachu into the furnace. In the same motion he hit the switch to bring up the energy barrier – preventing Pikachu's escape.</p>

<p>What followed were more screams than squeals. The little animal writhed as flames sprang to consume it; Ash shouted but, kept immobile from Houndoom's attack, could only bear horrified witness as his pet struggled and cried in the depths of a fire far more concentrated than any brief ember on a battlefield. Archer, in turn, watched <i>him</i>. And Cade watched <i>all three of them</i>, the subtle malice of a smile playing at his lips.</p>

<p>"Do you know it's actually possible for a living thing to incinerate while alive?" added Archer, still lecturing with that terrible mildness. "Not just alive, but in full conscious faculty..."</p>

<p>"Stop, please!" Ash pleaded, distraught.</p>

<p>"You know the coal covering its fur is only going to make it worse," observed Archer. "It'll be roasted like a brisket of Tauros."</p>

<p>"Make it <i>stop</i>!"</p>

<p>Archer twisted the dial into a small inferno.</p>

<p>"What do you want from us?" implored Ash.</p>

<p>"I want you to realize the futility of your efforts. I want you to realize destiny is mine and you should have stayed out of it."</p>

<p>The simple statement whirled violently in Ash's mind, torment without solution set against the backdrop of racked cries and that terrible image: a gleam of gold fur in a cast of unrelenting fire. There was a sickeningly burnt smell. He wrenched his gaze away in distraught anguish.</p>

<p>Archer forced Ash to look back, pulling him forward so hard that the nerves affected by Houndoom's energy stabbed in a strained, numb protest to this motion being imposed.</p>

<p>"No. <i>Watch</i>," Archer snarled, "Watch as your piteous electric rat gets barbecued to death. And know if you had any influence at all, you could have saved it."</p>

<p>"No..." answered Ash, and in a strange moment, he lifted his gaze to look directly at Archer and his voice acquired unusual calm, "...<i>you</i> could have saved <i>yourself</i>."</p>

<p>Ash's eyes had acquired a profound cold look; reminding Archer of someone else. Giovanni.</p>

<p>The remark and its delivery stunned Archer by how unexpected it was. It was enough for him to release his hold on Ash, and his captive once more turned away from the sight before him but continued to speak.</p>

<p>"You're already deep in debt. But the day you kill any of my friends..." Ash turned to face Cade, his voice suddenly bitter, "I'll personally make you pay."</p>

<p>Cade stared at him for a moment, something akin to a brief hesitance of doubt; then amusement soared in his eyes instead and he laughed long and loud.</p>

<p>"How funny...!" sneered Cade, at last speaking. "Junior thinks he can be scary like his dad."</p>

<p>Ash stared at him, fury unabated despite being mystified at Cade's words.</p>

<p>"Don't claim you don't know. Don't pretend to be naïve." Cade walked over and leant closer to him with incisive menace. "Someone of your distinguished heritage can't pull that off even if they tried... son of Giovanni Delavita."</p>

<p>The words were met with stunned disbelief within which came nothing to say. Finally Ash spoke again, his voice mired with concentrated hatred.</p>

<p>"Take Pikachu out of there."</p>

<p>Neither moved; Cade and Ash faced each other steadily, Pikachu's squeals growing fainter. Archer watched Cade expectantly and, at last, Cade gave him the awaited signal in a flourish, and Archer switched off the fire.</p>

<p>Ash shuddered and leant his body against the metal casing of the boiler. It was astonishingly cold; so cold it was nigh impossible to believe such furious fire could be kindled within. He looked from Pikachu lying limp in the coal dust to Archer, and then to Cade.</p>

<p>It was Cade directing all this, then. He was pondering this fact as Cade spoke. "You're very observant, aren't you, little Delavita?"</p>

<p>"I'm not Delavita," said Ash.</p>

<p>"No, you're not," agreed Cade. "You're Ash Ketchum, known in his small town as Red, and if you were half as skilled a trainer as your father Giovanni you'd probably never have been caught. None of which will make a difference when they find your dead body."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you'd do this."</p>

<p>"You're not meant to understand. Why must I have the misfortune of explaining to simple-minded people?" lamented Cade patronisingly.</p>

<p>He meant it rhetorically. He scarcely expected a response – first a woman's voice, then a man's.</p>

<p>"If you're asking for sympathies..." said Jessie.</p>

<p>"...we'll be here to deliver them," added James.</p>

<p>They poised atop one of the metal platforms, two svelte spectres of vengeance. The moment Cade saw them, a shiver coursed through his body.</p>

<p>"They survived," Cade realized, "How the hell did they know I was here?! You damned fool!" he turned to face Archer, infuriated. "You led them here."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, sir," Archer replied, dipping his head.</p>

<p>"You'll be grateful if I do." He directed Archer's attention brusquely back to the platform where Jessie and James stood. An inscrutable glance and smile passed between the two Team Rocket admins as Archer took a step forward.</p>

<p>"My former colleagues," Archer addressed them, "don't tell me Giovanni already sent you to collect my payment? Or perhaps you've come to beg to join us?"</p>

<p>James smirked. "Don't flatter yourself."</p>

<p>"The only thing we want is that Pikachu," answered Jessie.</p>

<p>"I think it's a little overdone," Archer countered indifferently. "Where's your mangy cat?"</p>

<p>Meowth leapt from the rafters overhead. Houndoom gave a pained yelp and spun, jaws snapping audibly, as Meowth's claws and fangs sank into its hide in a savagely shredding grasp. Houndoom fainted before either Cade or Archer could do more than turn and Ash, immediately freed from Shadow Hold's effects, tackled the boiler switch to snap the energy barrier off.</p>

<p>"Smokescreen," ordered James, opening a Poké Ball; in instant obedience Weezing emerged and engulfed the entire place in smoke.</p>

<p>In the ensuing smog, Cade raced for the exit and was gone before anyone could catch him. Meanwhile Archer began coughing, trying to search the haze for the deadly couple from Team Rocket.</p>

<p>"Where are they, <i>damn it</i>!?" Archer cursed under his breath. He pulled out a pistol, which he gripped tightly.</p>

<p>There was a flash of another Poké Ball being open; his eyes snapped towards it and the vague distinguishing of both Jessie and Arbok's silhouette.</p>

<p>Before he could shoot, Weezing tackled him and knocked the gun out of his hand, upon which Arbok sprang to wrap itself around him. The snake narrowly missed as Archer leapt aside only for him to end up grappling with James.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you three die when I hurled you into the stratosphere," snapped Archer.</p>

<p>"Archer why the hell are you listening to that guy?" James pursued, "You've always been the most loyal to Giovanni. He's your godfather damn it!"</p>

<p>"Giovanni's not the leader he once was. He's trying to disband Team Rocket," Archer countered.</p>

<p>"What...?"</p>

<p>Archer wrested free and snatched up the pistol from the ground, only to fire it multiple times at the ceiling. Concrete shards began to shower down from the old supporting columns of the building, and it began to fall to pieces.</p>

<p>Jessie tensed. "We'll all be crushed when the building collapses."</p>

<p>"You will, anyway," said Archer, tossing a Poké Ball lightly. When it struck the ground, a Pokémon was sent out: none other than one of the Legendary Beasts, the tiger Raikou.</p>

<p>"Raikou?" exclaimed James, "He's got a Raikou!"</p>

<p>Archer ignored his statement, instead he bounded nimbly onto Raikou's back. "Off," he ordered, and with a booming roar the creature bolted up to the roof through the now gaping hole and escaped.</p>

<p>"You're only postponing the inevitable...!" Jessie called after him.</p>

<p>"Forget him. Let's get the Pikachu and scram!" caterwauled Meowth.</p>

<p>Swiftly Jessie ran to the furnace.</p>

<p>Ash had successfully untied himself and he was scrambling to retrieve Pikachu. The little creature, too injured to react, lay limp in his arms.</p>

<p>No sooner had Ash gathered the badly burned Pikachu – Jessie wrenched it away from him.</p>

<p>"Those assholes, doing this to <i>our</i> rightfully stolen property," she hissed.</p>

<p>"You give him back!" exclaimed Ash, trying to grab Pikachu from her.</p>

<p>"We want it, not you!" In practised motion Jessie pushed Ash aside, and he fell with a gasp onto the floor.</p>

<p>Ash regained his footing quickly and sprang at her again. She reacted equally fast with the whip, and using the lash kept Ash at bay.</p>

<p>A creaking sound of metal brought Jessie's attention up all of a sudden, in time to see the pipes holding the furnace pillar loosen and the whole tower come crashing down towards her.</p>

<p>From behind James yanked Jessie out of the way. They ended up in each other's arms, clinging together with Pikachu in the middle and watching the ceiling overhead where the pipes had been anchored now crack into kaleidoscopic patterns.</p>

<p>"We should get out of here," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"On the double," James concurred.</p>

<p>"<i>Rrrrr</i>," agreed Meowth.</p>

<p>They were about to run for it when a shout made them instinctively glance back.</p>

<p>The debris that had nearly landed on Jessie had trapped Ash. He was trying to pull out from the rubble only to cry out when more rockfall nearly pinned him down; he fell back swift enough to save himself from being crushed but ended up being irrevocably separated from the exit, effectively sealed in a tomb.</p>

<p>Jessie and James turned pointedly away, but took only one step further before something stirred again, more adamantly; humanity they resolutely tried to push away but could never reject completely.</p>

<p>"Oh, fuck it!" cursed Jessie, and she and James ran back to save him.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the stone rubble, they sent out their Pokémon again. It was a race against the clock – a senseless one, thought Jessie and James, lamenting what they felt was meaningless morality.</p>

<p>"Arbok try to push these boulders aside," ordered Jessie.</p>

<p>"Weezing, smash the rocks," James directed.</p>

<p>Meowth leapt onto the stones and even he tried to move them, though the cat was too small to assist much.</p>

<p>There was utter confusion in Ash's eyes, but he would not refuse the help. Between the joint efforts of the trio and of the trapped trainer himself, Ash managed to get loose from the debris. The moment he was freed, he snatched Pikachu out of Jessie's arms.</p>

<p>"Weezing, use Protect!" James ordered his Pokémon.</p>

<p>In a cloak of unseen energy, Weezing enveloped the little group in a barrier. The raining boulders were blocked from hitting them, and James, Jessie, Ash and the animals were shielded long enough for them to get outside. They were in time to bear witness, from a safe distance, as the last of the building crumbled into dust.</p>

<p>They gazed at the now-decimated structure as Pidgey roosting in nearby trees scattered from the last of the noise. It was already dawn; the glow of newborn morning still in its faint and dewy stage.</p>

<p>Ash cradled the unconscious Pikachu carefully, not reacting even when the others looked over at him.</p>

<p>"It's hopeless," said Ash bitterly. "We're too far from help..."</p>

<p>His voice halted somewhat and faded away.</p>

<p>The Team Rocket trio considered the sorry sight briefly, and exchanged ambivalent glances; in resignation, James turned towards Ash:</p>

<p>"There's a Pokémon Center not far from here. We'll get you there."</p><hr />

<p>Pikachu looked tinier than ever on that gurney; a frail little creature far from the vivacious animal the trio had set out to steal.</p>

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth had gone as far as to help Ash to the Pokémon Center they knew to be in this area. It was right outside the Rock Tunnel caves, a rest stop out in no-man's-land. They made certain Pikachu was being tended to, and then discreetly retreated outside.</p>

<p>The whole thing was awkward to them. They wanted to keep to themselves, partly because they feared someone there would try to be a 'good citizen' and call the authorities, and the last thing they wanted was interference in issues that were their syndicate's – and their syndicate's alone – to contend with.</p>

<p>Ash did call someone, but it was his mother Delia.</p>

<p>"They say they had to amplify Chansey's Heal Pulse abilities to do any good. If it wasn't for modern medicine and the fact we got here quickly, Pikachu would be dead," he recounted to her bluntly.</p>

<p>Delia was very silent as he told the story, and Ash noticed it.</p>

<p>"Mom? are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ash. I'm listening, and thinking."</p>

<p>There was silence between them, and Ash decided to just break it with a question.</p>

<p>"I overheard something Mom, and I want to know if it's true or not... Is Giovanni Delavita my biological father?"</p>

<p>"It's true. Giovanni is your father."</p>

<p>"Why...?" Ash asked simply, "Why did you keep that from me?"</p>

<p>"I never wanted you involved in your father's work," Delia insisted. "He inherited a dark profession and built it into an empire that measures success by who lives and who dies. I love him, I've always loved him, and he loves me...but his business is...dangerous."</p>

<p>"Danger?" Ash echoed. "After everything that's happened? I've already been thrust into danger I never even sought out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ash...don't be upset."</p>

<p>"No I'm not. I couldn't be. It's just..." His voice trailed away. "I'm just worried about Pikachu."</p>

<p>"Ash, your Pikachu is strong. I think he'll be all right."</p>

<p>With all said, they both hung up their phones.</p><hr />

<p>Everyone on the streets below rushed about immersed in their own hectic lives, few noticing the three figures atop the Pokémon Center.</p>

<p>Jessie and James sat lounging together on the roof's edge, trying to make sense of their tumultuous day and, if nothing else, take in what solitary peace remained of that faded starlit night. Meowth groomed his paws and face beside them, nonchalant as ever.</p>

<p>"Maybe we really are too soft," James was saying. "We lose track of Archer and that corrupt mayor, and – of our own accord – end up saving the twerp and returning Pikachu... leaving us right back where we started with nothing to show for it."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed. "I can't believe we fucked up so badly."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say it's so much as <i>badly</i>," Meowth purred, continuing to groom his face, "it's just you two define Murphy's Law."</p>

<p>James and Jessie exchanged a glance and finding the confusion mutual, turned back to the cat. "What's that supposed to mean?" James asked.</p>

<p>"You're the best at being the worst," Meowth replied matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"It's either the world's most polite insult or the most offensive compliment," Jessie observed dryly.</p>

<p>The cat squinted at them and purred.</p>

<p>"Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>The introduction of a new speaker made the trio turn attentively around. To their surprise, they discovered Ash had joined them on the rooftop.</p>

<p>Ash briefly weighed his words but spoke honestly. "I never got to thank you for helping rescue us."</p>

<p>There was an awkward moment, and James finally answered him. "Well...don't mention it. <i>Don't</i>. It'd make us look like goody-goodies."</p>

<p>Ash nodded, but something else seemed to be on his mind. "Do you know anything about what Cade said?"</p>

<p>Jessie gave a disdainful scoff. "He said a lot of things."</p>

<p>"He said Giovanni Delavita is my father."</p>

<p>To this came a distinctly astonished unease; they all remained silent.</p>

<p>"Is that why you rescued me?" asked Ash.</p>

<p>"We went to get Pikachu. You just happened to be there," Jessie admitted bluntly. "We don't know anything else."</p>

<p>"You don't know or you can't say?" Ash pursued.</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed. "You ask too many questions, twerp."</p>

<p>"I think I have a right to ask," he maintained.</p>

<p>Neither James, Jessie, nor Meowth responded to this. In truth, how could they respond? The trio knew very well of Giovanni's feelings towards Delia Ketchum, but discovering a possible lovechild of this union was unexpected even to them. Even if they had been sure, they were reluctant to say so for fear of incurring the boss' wrath should he wish it kept secret.</p>

<p>Ash evidently saw their hesitance, and with reasoned tact appeared to change the topic. "You once asked me if I would like to join Team Rocket."</p>

<p>James gave a pursed smile. "Only because, you know, having you join willingly is a lot easier than having to steal your Pokémon just to get them on our side. Forget about it."</p>

<p>"Except maybe I <i>do</i> want to join," ventured Ash.</p>

<p>The trio regarded him with surprise.</p>

<p>"I'd like to discuss it with Giovanni," Ash said cautiously. "Please take me to see him."</p>

<p>Somehow the outside of the mansion, for as lovely as it was, appeared humble the moment one stepped inside. The interior was like a palace; ebony furnishings stood alongside champagne flooring of the finest Botticino marble, the décor pure lavish elegance, and overhead a chandelier shimmered as if it were made of diamonds. A staircase sloped gently up to the second level, where the Persian sat gracefully observant of the goings-on below.</p>

<p>From the unreadable look on Ash's face, James wondered if he was awed at the splendour of this place, the fact it existed in such forested seclusion near the large city, or merely surprised the Viridian City gym leader actually lived in Celadon's outlying suburbia. Of course, Giovanni's legal residence was a more modest Viridian house that was one of many properties he owned, and not this elegant Celadon mansion where he really dwelt, but the residency requirement for politicians and gym leaders to have local homes had many loopholes.</p>

<p>Pikachu clung to Ash's cap as usual, but it growled if anyone tried to pet it. The instantaneous healing of modern medicine had removed all traces of its burns; the only remaining sign of the little creature's ordeal was the guardedness with which it now regarded humans other than Ash.</p>

<p>If deep down James and Jessie felt partly responsible for having abducted Pikachu to begin with, they would never have admitted it, and quickly succeeded in sweeping aside this bothersome sentiment upon convincing themselves they only felt bad because it turned out to be the pet of the boss' son... plus, they had told their boss the newly found information about how Archer was now in possession of a Raikou; something that surprised him and somewhat distracted the conversation. At least Giovanni had not been angry with them regarding the mix-up regarding Ash.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he had been glad to hear they'd saved him. They did not entertain the thought as to what would have happened if they hadn't. He not only confirmed Ash was his son, but that Ash's mother was none other than Delia – who was now his fianceé. For Jessie and James it placed them in the very awkward situation of realizing the 'twerp', for all intents and purposes, was Giovanni's heir if Ash would accept inheriting his rightful place when the time came.</p>

<p>"I've never seen a place so luxurious," Ash remarked, confirming what had been on his mind.</p>

<p>Meowth gave a chirpy meow. "The boss likes to live large, twerp. His place here is fancier than the League offices up at the Indigo Plateau."</p>

<p>"I can imagine," Ash said.</p>

<p>"Ash." His mother's voice made him spin around. Delia was standing there with Giovanni by her side. The large cat Pokemon leapt down from the staircase and joined his master.</p>

<p>"We finally have our family together. It's a good day...isn't that so, Persian?" Giovanni said to his cat.</p>

<p>The feline <i>consigliere</i> wrapped itself around its master's legs in a hug.</p>

<p>They were ushered to the dining room and seated.  Jessie, James, and Meowth lingered at a distance at different ends of the room as silent guards. The servants served their dinner and after a while of eating, Ash broke the silence with a point-blank question:</p>

<p>"Mom, why did you and father break up?"</p>

<p>Delia and Giovanni looked at each other and Delia explained, "Ash, the truth is those were very violent years in our region's history. When I found out I was pregnant with you, it was around the time that your father was given control of his family business and well...I didn't want you to grow up in it."</p>

<p>Giovanni jumped into the conversation. "We never stopped loving each other, Ash...but I understood her opinion and I also thought it was a way of protecting her from all the feuds that were ongoing."</p>

<p>"At some point," added Delia, "as years started rolling by, I thought maybe he had forgotten me and I felt awkward of approaching him so..."</p>

<p>"So we loved each other from afar," Giovanni finished. "The day your mother came to me in the office to tell me you were my son was simply a confirmation of what my heart had always known."</p>

<p>It was all very pretty and very romantic, and Ash was truly happy for his parents, but his mind still reeled over the whole revelation of being related to the boss of Team Rocket – <i>the</i> infamous Team Rocket. The idea of his father managing that sinister enterprise of stolen Pokémon and contract killings gave this otherwise joyful reunion a slightly sour taste, though Ash tried to swallow it down with his usual mild diplomacy.</p>

<p>Pikachu was far less moralistic and had already warmed up to them, evidently having decided that anyone against the people who hurt it were hereby its friends. It had no qualms whatsoever about its new friends being gangsters. If anything, Pikachu seemed to like the idea of being the pet of someone in a position of power, much more than Ash would have liked it to. It sat happily alongside Giovanni's Persian, each with their bowl of food.</p>

<p>Ash wasn't sure when the conversation flitted from wedding plans and happy fantasies to the family business, but he wished it hadn't. He could sense James and Jessie watching inobstrusively from the sidelines, interested in everything being said even though they were well-mannered enough not to interfere. Delia distanced herself from the discussion as Giovanni explained a bit to Ash about the many investments of Rocket Enterprises, or as everyone knew it better, Team Rocket.</p>

<p>"A sign of a well-run business is dependability and efficiency. That's what I've got and that's what I aim to keep," he said finally.</p>

<p>"But father..." Ash was briefly unsure how or even if he ought to say it, and ended up being boldly direct, "...what about the people you kill?"</p>

<p>Giovanni lifted a hand momentarily. "Unreliable business associates are <i>eliminated</i>, for the good of the organization," he corrected. "I take no pleasure in hurting people pointlessly."</p>

<p>Ash looked like he would have protested, but again he was not so tactless to express these sentiments now at the dinner, especially when he had only recently come to learn the truths of his parentage. Yet perhaps Giovanni could tell of Ash's displeasure at the matter, for he went on clarifyingly.</p>

<p>"I'm someone with power," explained Giovanni. "There is no such thing as good or evil when it comes to power. There is only power...and those who are willing to use it. You'll come to see that soon enough."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Ash replied, "but I'd never be an executioner. I could never kill anyone, least of all in cold blood."</p>

<p>He turned to his pet, who was munching happily on Pokémon kibble. "Pikachu agrees with me. Don't you buddy?"</p>

<p>"<i>Piii</i>." It...wanted a small shirt with an R. The request was met by a side-eyed glance by Ash and no reply.</p>

<p>Persian gave a couple of meows, which Ash could tell were clearly a translation when Giovanni stifled a chuckle.</p>

<p>Ash sighed, and muttered to himself, "How can death be treated so frivolously?"</p>

<p>"Vendettas are never to be taken <i>frivolously</i>," replied Giovanni. "I think your Pokémon understands that."</p>

<p>Ash restrained a scowl. Pikachu went on eating without a care.</p>

<p>"The organization that held you hostage is called Cipher," Giovanni said. "It's a rival syndicate, headed by a disgruntled business associate of ours."</p>

<p>"Why is he disgruntled?" Ash asked.</p>

<p>"We currently own his company."</p>

<p><i>Maybe I shouldn't have asked,</i> thought Ash.</p>

<p>"The leader's name is Mr. Rose," recounted Giovanni, "You might recognize the name since his activities in the Galar region were highly publicized a few years back...he now lives in Orre. Mr. Cade, who you unfortunately met at the power plant, is the mayor of a city in Orre and has been working with him."</p>

<p>Giovanni hesitated, his gaze briefly faltering as he added quietly:</p>

<p>"The other man you met at the power plant was Archer, my godson. He'd gone missing a couple of weeks back."</p>

<p>"Archer didn't look like he was acting of his own accord," Ash told him. "Honestly he looked like his mind was affected somehow. Cade was ordering everything. There was something strange about all the Pokémon they had with them too."</p>

<p>"From what we've been able to learn, those were Shadow Pokémon. They're more powerful than regular Pokémon."</p>

<p>"They look traumatized."</p>

<p>"They get that way," Giovanni explained, "after being subjected to a special laser affecting their nervous system. Cipher then backs it up with abusive re-training sessions until even the stolen Pokémon are compliant. They become practically invincible in battle. If we can get in that racket by producing Shadow Pokémon for ourselves..."</p>

<p>"You just said they've been put through abuse!" Ash interjected with repulsion. "I saw what those poor Pokémon are like firsthand. Team Rocket can't possibly do the same," he said, and added emphatically, "We need to live alongside Pokémon. They're worth more than profit for a business enterprise; they're our friends."</p>

<p>"When your enemies think otherwise you have no choice but to be as ruthless as they," countered Giovanni.</p>

<p>"There has to be a way to reason with them," Ash replied, "everybody has some good in them."</p>

<p>"A childish fantasy," Giovanni smiled, in a gesture that was affectionate yet could easily have been patronising. "And I doubt someone as young as you would ever understand what I hope to achieve."</p>

<p>Ash flinched, but the words weren't delivered harshly. The syndicate don went on graciously:</p>

<p>"In any case I was told you might be interested in joining Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"I just want to stop Cade." Ash faced Giovanni with directness. "The longer he spends out there, the more Pokémon will suffer from this cruelty. If Cipher is behind it, then we'll stop them too...besides I want my revenge for what was done to Pikachu."</p>

<p>"That's a start," responded Giovanni approvingly.</p>

<p>That decided, the topic of conversation shifted to Ash's journey. It was a less-contentious matter he much preferred discussing.</p>

<p>"How many badges do you have left to go?" Giovanni sounded like he already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"I have three badges," Ash told him.</p>

<p>"So you're almost half-way there," noted Giovanni.</p>

<p>Ash decided to test the waters. "Saffron City was cordoned off. If it wasn't for that I could've tried for a fourth badge."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Saffron," the Team Rocket boss smiled subtly.</p>

<p>"Well, there was a Snorlax blocking the entrance via route 8, and through route 5 an...unexpected toll booth." Ash found such indirect ways of speaking difficult.</p>

<p>Giovanni encouraged his attempt. "I'll see the toll is waived."</p>

<p>How easy things were becoming, like all the roadblocks had been lifted all at once. Ash merely stared at his father. "Does no one get ahead in Kanto without having some affiliation to Team Rocket?" he asked point-blank.</p>

<p>"We try not to let it happen," Giovanni responded demurely. "Still, it wouldn't suit an Elite Four challenger to be unversed in proper battle technique."</p>

<p>"I'm not—" Ash began saying.</p>

<p>"Out of the three badges you won, the Pewter gym was due to being lucky and getting a critical hit, the Cerulean gym was due to your Pokémon's type advantage, and the Celadon gym was due to the gym leader feeling indisposed and eager to get home early so she threw the match."</p>

<p>Such straightfoward knowledge of his progress unsettled Ash, but even more discouraging was the new information. He didn't know Erika of Celadon had gifted him the victory. The fact he hadn't even detected it meant he did have much to learn when it came to Pokémon.</p>

<p>Giovanni was not disparaging at all. "If you'd like I'll see that you're trained in the finer points of Pokémon battling."</p>

<p>Forcing away disquietude, Ash considered it openly. "Well, I'd never turn down an opportunity to get better at what I do. Who would be the instructors? The Viridian gym apprentices?"</p>

<p>"They're low rank," replied Giovanni, and only then did Ash realize that the entire staff of the Viridian gym must be Team Rocket members. "If you're going to learn it should be from the best. I'm assigning only the strongest and most skilled fighters of Team Rocket."</p>

<p>Ash couldn't disagree with that.</p>

<p>Overlooking their points of difference was central when both parties sought peace. Ash tried to be easygoing enough to get along with, and Giovanni also made the effort; all things considered, the meeting went far better than it could have. They found despite their drastic worldviews, they really had much in common. Giovanni had raised Persian from a kitten, and shared the same strong bond with it that Ash did with Pikachu. It stood out that both Ash and Giovanni had learnt the language of their starter Pokémon, a rare talent that, it seemed, was hereditary; even Giovanni's great-grandfather had apparently been able to communicate with his most trusted Pokémon.</p>

<p>"I suspect we're distantly related to the Harmonias," admitted Giovanni, referencing the famous Unovan councilman who could understand all animal language, "but I haven't had time to do a proper genealogical search."</p>

<p>After dinner they all spent a couple of hours engaged in family conversation and so when the pendulum clock at the entryway of the house rang nine times, they were all surprised at how fast time had passed by.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" exclaimed Delia, "I can't believe it's this late."</p>

<p>Giovanni looked at her and said, "I think it would be safer if you and Ash would spend the night... With Cipher's people still on our territory, the roads are not as safe as they used to be."</p>

<p>Delia looked into his eyes and saw the same tender look that he would always have in their past youth.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gio," she replied softly, "I like that idea."</p>

<p>Ash looked back and forth from one parent to another and saw the passion reflected in their eyes. He had no memory of ever seeing his mother this happy.</p>

<p>"Okay. Sure," Ash said, "Where's my room?"</p>

<p>Giovanni clapped his hands and two butlers entered the dining room.</p>

<p>"Show my son to his quarters," he told one of them, "See that he is comfortable and lacks for nothing."</p>

<p>Pikachu, who had been seated at one of the chairs at the table next to Ash, hopped onto his shoulders and squeaked. "<i>Pika pi</i>!"</p>

<p>"Let's go, Pikachu," Ash told him, as the butler led the way.</p>

<p>Giovanni faced the other butler and said, "Make sure there is a bottle of champagne on ice and two goblets in my sleeping quarters."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," the butler replied and left to his chore.</p>

<p>This left Giovanni and Delia alone.</p>

<p>He gathered her in his arms and whispered in her ear, "At last...My darling, there wasn't a day that went by when I didn't think about you...all these years. I love you."</p>

<p>"Oh Gio," she whispered back, "I never stopped loving you."</p>

<p>They kissed, with the same passion they had in their younger years, and when they finished he took her by the hand, led her up the staircase to his bedroom where the champagne was waiting, and closed the door behind them.</p><hr />

<p>The next morning Giovanni and Delia came down to breakfast arm in arm.</p>

<p>The table was set with a lace tablecloth, porcelain plates and silver cutlery. Different kinds of breakfast foods, including bowls of fruit, were spread out on a buffet table nearby.</p>

<p>"What a feast!" Delia said in surprise.</p>

<p>"If you don't see what you want my dear, just ask the butler to prepare it," Giovanni said.</p>

<p>After filling their plates, they sat down and he added, "Sweetheart, have you thought about what we discussed, about your moving in? This is your home now."</p>

<p>"Yes Gio," she answered, "I will get some of my things and move in... Little by little... I plan on putting the house in Ash's name and he can stay living there."</p>

<p>At that moment, Ash came briskly walking into the dining area. "Good morning!" he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Did you have a restful night?" Giovanni asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes I did. It had been a long time that Pikachu and I managed to sleep through the night."</p>

<p>The little Pokémon concurred via a chirpy squeak.</p>

<p>"Ash," his mother said, "I am moving here with your father... You can use our old place as your own...I will be putting it in your name soon."</p>

<p>"Okay," Ash answered simply and proceeded to choose his breakfast from the buffet.</p>

<p>He sat down and they all ate their breakfast in silence.</p>

<p>When breakfast was done, Giovanni got up, put his hand on her back and bent down as she turned her face to him. He kissed her tenderly and said, "I have business to tend to my dear. I expect to be home for dinner this evening."</p>

<p>"Gio, I will go to my house to start the move, but I will try to be here before you arrive."</p>

<p>He kissed her again, and waved to Ash as he walked off.</p>

<p>Ash wandered out of Celadon to route 7, where the instructors Giovanni was sending were supposed to meet him. The forest path was always peaceful, but at this early hour especially so. Cold breezes sifted through the boughs of the trees, unleashing leaves in a plentiful cascade. Dew still shimmered like fragile frost across the grass, yet the dawn had already turned bright and the Pidgey were singing praises of the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>He reached a leaf-strewn clearing off the main road, and was about to turn back when Jessie and James showed up. Meowth was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"You two?" Ash did not know why he was surprised. They had never shown themselves to be anything but astute and ferocious, and certainly had that air of danger, but perhaps it was the modesty with which they carried themselves in all other respects; they certainly looked tame in civilian clothes.</p>

<p>Jessie seemed to read his mind and smiled smugly, but it was James who responded. "Surprised?" he asked. "We want people to see us as inept at least half the time. It makes it easier to work."</p>

<p>"I never thought you were inept," Ash said.</p>

<p>"But you didn't expect us to be Giovanni's top people either," James discerned.</p>

<p>"Well... no," Ash conceded.</p>

<p>"Good. Then we haven't lost our talent for hiding in plain sight," Jessie remarked cheerfully to James.</p>

<p>In the midst of this Meowth scampered up from the bracken to join them.</p>

<p>"Meowth," greeted Jessie. "What took you so long?"</p>

<p>"I had cat things to wrap up," explained Meowth.</p>

<p>"You and your cat things," scoffed James.</p>

<p>"Which're more important than human things," hissed the cat.</p>

<p>"How did you ever teach your Meowth to talk?" Ash could not help but satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p>"He taught himself," Jessie replied, which really did not answer the question.</p>

<p>"And you got this the wrong way around," added Meowth, "I'm not their Meowth; they're my humans."</p>

<p>"Says who?" James queried, turning towards the cat.</p>

<p>"I've trained you to feed me, not the other way round," justified Meowth. "Or at the very least you put up the cash so I can order takeout."</p>

<p>"He's got a point, James," said Jessie with a little smile.</p>

<p>Ash fidgeted as they turned back to him. "The boss sent us out here to train <i>you</i>. That's what he told you, isn't it?" asked James.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Ash affirmed.</p>

<p>"All right," said Jessie. "What's your goal? We'll go from there."</p>

<p>Ash straightened up. "My goal is to become a Pokémon Master."</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Jessie.</p>

<p>This question utterly perplexed him. She elaborated:</p>

<p>"To some people it would mean becoming League champion. To others it would mean catching one of each Pokémon. Or it would mean winning with a pedigreed show animal in Pokémon Contests. There is no one-size-fits-all for being a Pokémon Master."</p>

<p>Ash thought this over. To his frustration it still stymied him.</p>

<p>Jessie broke in again. "We can start with perfecting your battle technique. You'll no doubt figure out the rest as we make progress."</p><hr />

<p>Arbok and Weezing reared back as Ash boldly made the first move.</p>

<p>"Pikachu, Quick Attack!" he ordered.</p>

<p>Pikachu darted forward to tackle. The moment it struck, however, Weezing retaliated with a close-range Sludge Bomb. Ink sprayed across Pikachu's eyes and, now completely disoriented, it was easy for Arbok to spring swiftly at a signal from Jessie and wrap itself around the electric type Pokémon - immobilizing it.</p>

<p>James gave a slightly amused shake of his head.</p>

<p>"Avoid taking risks rashly. Think through how your enemy could respond."</p>

<p>As he thought about this, Ash's eyes drifted off to Meowth. The cat was grooming himself indifferently.</p><hr />

<p>"They sell thunder stones at the Celadon department store," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"No," said Ash, adamant, "I'm not evolving Pikachu. Pikachu told me he likes his current form. I'll only evolve him when and if he decides to become a Raichu."</p>

<p>"Most Team Rocket agents aren't so understanding with their Pokémon," Jessie posed.</p>

<p>Ash stiffened anticipatively. It had barely been one week into their training, and he was expecting a quarrel. He did not expect agreeing smiles from James and Jessie.</p>

<p>"I'll confide you this – we've never understood those agents," she said.</p>

<p>"A Pokémon fights more enthusiastically if it has a trainer that cares about its feelings," admitted James. "That said there's only one other way to win against a strong opponent with an unevolved Pokémon. You'll need to use status moves to reduce your opponent's accuracy and charge your own electric power."</p>

<p>"You mean moves like Double Team?" Ash asked quizzically. "I've always taught Pikachu other attacks instead. If a move doesn't do any actual damage, what's the point?"</p>

<p>"Stat changes make the difference between victory or defeat when a low level Pokémon goes up against a high level one. I once saw a Pidgey take down a Rhydon that way," James mentioned. Ash wondered if it was in the Viridian gym; he knew Giovanni owned a Rhydon. The idea of a small bird like a Pidgey defeating such a massive creature seemed so incredible to Ash's mind that he wished he could've seen the fight.</p>

<p>"More importantly, it lowers the opponent's guard," Jessie added, "and that's central to all combat."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't let your enemy know the extent of your abilities."</p>

<p>Ash considered this. He glanced curiously at Meowth, who had angled an ear towards their conversation briefly but decided it was uninteresting and turned instead to pawing at a falling leaf.</p><hr />

<p>Electricity arced from Pikachu, a jagged intermittent flash that stabbed at its opponents. For every electric attack Pikachu gave forth however, Arbok and Weezing both managed to strike first.</p>

<p>"Your Pikachu is very strong, but our Pokémon are faster," Jessie noted.</p>

<p>Ash allowed himself to get a bit haughty. "We don't need to be speedy to beat you."</p>

<p>"Maybe so, or maybe not," evaluated James, and then his eyes glinted.</p>

<p>"If that Pikachu was strong <i>and</i> fast though, you'd be nearly unbeatable."</p>

<p>Meowth was sitting, paws tucked underneath himself in a loaf, watching everything with appraisal.</p><hr />

<p>Pikachu raced so swiftly as to practically dance around Arbok and Weezing, its nimble bounds and dodges so distinct from a month prior.</p>

<p>This was thrilling to Ash, who could see how far they had come. Experience was always something desired, but to see it present and put to practice was exciting. Pikachu followed his orders instantly, darting in tandem with them in an electrified glow from one end of the field to the other and striking before its opponents could react.</p>

<p>Ash was so enthralled with how he was winning the battle that he barely noticed Meowth had crouched in pouncing posture, his tail lashing and eyes fixed on Pikachu's motions, nor how Jessie and James exchanged a glance and a subtle smile.</p>

<p>In an instant Meowth leapt into the fray, assailing Pikachu viciously with his claws and spinning the combat unexpectedly into a triple-battle. Ash had scarcely oriented himself to this new development when the flight of James' rose thrown towards him drew his attention off the battlefield, and without warning he was suddenly entangled in Jessie's whip.</p>

<p>Direct attack on his person was something he had not imagined. The lash held fast, despite Ash's struggles; Pikachu was faltering in the outnumbered battle, and for a moment worry flickered as to whether the fight was about to turn deadly after all.</p>

<p>He quickly realized the intent remained demonstration. Of all the lessons till now, Jessie had never spoken quite so seriously as this:</p>

<p>"Never assume your opponent battles with the same honor you do."</p><hr />

<p>Ash had reached the second stage of his training. The only way to be ready for foul play, explained the Team Rocket trio, was to have a ready knowledge of self defense. And if they were going to spend time teaching him self defense, well, they may as well teach him full military strategy and weapons usage; why not? Ash went along with it to see how far they would really go, and Pikachu sat on the sidelines with Meowth to watch the spectacle.</p>

<p>The whip was standard issue for all Team Rocket recruits, and skill with the dagger was mandatory – or so they explained. Jessie would instruct him in the use of the former, with James to teach the latter.</p>

<p>"You see Jessie's better with the whip. I'm better with the knife," James mentioned.</p>

<p>Ash opened his mouth to ask something, then thought more lucidly of it. "I'm better not asking."</p>

<p>"You're learning, kid!" purred Meowth approvingly.</p>

<p>"The trick to whip combat is <i>distance</i>," explained Jessie, "Long-range with the lash, mid-range with strangulation, short-range striking with the handle. Learn all you can because you're going to need it for your next trial."</p>

<p>This aforementioned 'next trial' awaiting him was kept with unusual secrecy till Ash had gotten the hang of using the whip. Finally, Jessie told him what they had planned.</p>

<p>"You're going to battle a Pokémon."</p>

<p>"Again?" Ash remarked, "Pikachu can beat any Pokémon you send out."</p>

<p>"That's not what we said," smiled Jessie slyly.</p>

<p>It was only when she tossed him the whip that realization fell on him.</p>

<p>"Your opponent is Meowth," announced Jessie, jerking her head towards the feline.</p>

<p>Ash turned in disbelief towards the cat, which had outstretched a hind leg and was grooming indifferently.</p>

<p>"Are you serious?" Ash exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Don't you know how Pokémon battles were conducted in the days before Poké Balls?" prompted James. "What do you expect to do if you're ever separated from your Pokémon and attacked directly? Sometimes shit happens."</p>

<p>The truth was Ash was starting to wish he had paid more attention in history class back in the day, but the fact remained it seemed too barbaric for his liking and he remained firm. "I'm not whipping Meowth."</p>

<p>"Good," purred Meowth, "this'll be easy!"</p>

<p>The cat launched himself at Ash with a screech, claws bared, and the result was a haphazard race around the clearing as Ash tried futilely to flee or block Meowth's Fury Swipes.</p>

<p>It ended with Ash flat on his back, Meowth pinning him down.</p>

<p>"At that low level, you'd be lucky to beat a Pidgey!" purred Meowth.</p>

<p>"Get off me, cat," Ash grumbled, pushing the squinting, contented Meowth off.</p>

<p>Jessie seemed to be evaluating him. "Your technique is lacking, but your defense was OK. The biggest problem you have is a conscience. We need to work on getting rid of that."</p>

<p>Ash stood up, dusting himself off as he tossed the whip back to her. "This is pointless. If people can fight just as well as Pokémon, it's almost defeating the purpose of being a trainer."</p>

<p>"You don't get it, do you," James observed.</p>

<p>When Ash looked at them quizzically, Jessie added, "The point isn't that you fight instead of your Pokémon. The point is that you fight <i>with</i> your Pokémon."</p>

<p>She smiled genuinely.</p>

<p>"That's why it's called teamwork."</p><hr />

<p>The rest of their training turned into a blur for Ash. He had been tasked with everything from running a veritable gauntlet – "It's properly known as parkour," James had said, as if that made it better – to trying to best them both in hand-to-hand combat.</p>

<p>Exhaustion was the overarching sentiment in that time in Ash's mind, and it was hard to keep himself awake when they arbitrarily insisted on holding late-night training sessions one week – "I'm up; I'm up...<i>damn it</i>!" cursed Ash, upon getting bitten awake by Meowth – but the one thing he felt grateful for was they never asked him to participate in any of their seedier operations, such as thievery, poaching, or worse. Nonetheless worry plagued his mind between sleep deprivation and overwork, and he wondered what he would do if it came to that, but his worry never manifested as an ultimatum.</p>

<p>The reality was Jessie and James knew Ash did not have either heart or stomach for their work. He might have agreed to join them, but he had feelings of sympathy he could not hide, and they did not see the need to place him in a situation where this would be overtly challenged, at least not without their boss' explicit orders. Sympathy was not foreign to <i>them</i> either; Jessie and James had merely learnt to restrain it for the sake of cold-blooded logic, and they had every conviction Ash would one day find himself the same eventually – "It's something that happens," said Jessie, "whether you like it or not, as a natural course of events, because life can be fucked up like that."</p>

<p>For the majority of that long month they trained tirelessly in this vein. For one week after they gave Ash a break, and the first day of this vacation he spent sprawled in bed till noon.</p><hr />

<p>By now camaraderie had bloomed within their thorny animosity; the sort of friendship where they spoke bluntly, bickered sharply, and then instantly dropped the quarrel by realizing it was lunchtime and going out to eat together.</p>

<p>James and Jessie would always change into civilian clothes first. Only once did they decide to go attired in full uniform, on the pretext they were too starving to give a damn, but it had secretly been to show Ash what would happen.</p>

<p>They had not done anything more than walk in and quietly announce themselves as a party of three from Rocket Enterprises, yet it resulted in people scrambling in fright to give them the best table and service. Ash almost felt guilty for being there. In contrast, Pikachu took advantage of it to swipe a whole ketchup bottle all for itself.</p>

<p>"Flamboyancy is fun, but it needs to have a purpose," explained James, as they ate. "Otherwise it'll lose its impact."</p>

<p>Ash was still trying to align their duality in his mind. They were what they were; he remembered the bloody scene he had stumbled across in Lavender Town, and despite all this they were always genuinely gracious with everyone, the least likely people in his mind to be paid killers. Finally he just decided to ask:</p>

<p>"How did you ever end up in Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>Jessie answered him in a simplistic way. "We found you have to make your own happiness where you can. The only kindness ever extended to us was from Team Rocket and each other. To us, that's worth our loyalty."</p>

<p>It was vague enough to Ash yet not so cryptic as to be incomprehensible. Whatever their individual backstories were, it evidently pained them too much to go into detail; for this realization alone, he felt oddly sympathetic.</p>

<p>"By the way," James switched subjects, "I wonder where Cade and Archer have gone. We haven't seen a whisker of them since that situation at the power plant."</p>

<p>"Probably they've left the region," replied Jessie. "After all, Cade knows what Giovanni will have done to him if he and his goons stick around."</p>

<p>"Frankly <i>I</i> don't want to know," Ash said. The memory of them hurting Pikachu still aggravated him.</p>

<p>"Whether you like it or not, soon you'll have to know," Jessie pointed out gently. "This is Team Rocket business after all and you're part of it."</p>

<p>"I guess," conceded Ash, who at this point was watching Pikachu attack the ketchup bottle. "I want the people who did that punished, but somehow I'm still not accustomed to how our syndicate does things. Somehow I doubt I ever will be."</p>

<p>"It's a business matter, that's all," replied James. "There's not much depth to it. Kind of a peculiarity of our corporate culture."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," Jessie turned to her companion in a sudden happiness, "James...it's time he learned our motto."</p>

<p>"You're right, Jessie," he agreed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"We have a motto?" Ash echoed, turning back to them.</p>

<p>They recited it with natural flair, even though they were merely sitting around the table; somehow Ash could picture them up on a theatre stage for how they delivered the lines, each in turn, with flawless dramatism.</p>

<p>"Prepare for trouble!" Jessie began.</p>

<p>"...and make it double!" James followed after.</p>

<p>"To protect the world from devastation!"</p>

<p>"To unite all people within our nation!"</p>

<p>"To denounce the evils of truth and love!"</p>

<p>"To extend our reach to the stars above!"</p>

<p>"Jessie!"</p>

<p>"James!"</p>

<p>"Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!"</p>

<p>"Surrender now or prepare to fight!"</p>

<p>"...and then Meowth jumps in to say 'That's right!' " added Jessie, rather annoyed, "if he were here, which he isn't, because he's taken to prowling in the daytime too and we have no clue where the fuck he's going."</p>

<p>"When do you say this again?" Ash questioned dubiously.</p>

<p>"Mostly to rally our minions," Jessie replied.</p>

<p>"We wanted to say it every time we show up to raise hell somewhere, but Giovanni put his foot down," James admitted wryly.</p>

<p>Ash could not tell if they were being serious or not. He merely watched as the waiter brought the bill and James paid it, the suddenly wide eyes and profuse thanks of the man receiving a handsome gratuity, and the little group walked out of the restaurant as uneventfully as they had come.</p>

<p>"What does that even mean?" asked Ash as they strolled down the sidewalk together. "Uniting people and protecting the world? It makes it sound like we're some kind of governmental organization instead of a criminal syndicate."</p>

<p>"We're basically the private enterprise version of government," James provided a correlation, albeit a questionable one in Ash's view. "Think about it...what we do, we're merely safeguarding our interests and those of our allies, and collecting fees for our valuable service to the community."</p>

<p>"Look, no offence intended..." began Ash.</p>

<p>"No offence taken," interjected James. "How are you going to learn without saying some stupidity first?"</p>

<p>So Ash spoke, more emboldened. "It just seems you're...umm...we're... basically well-dressed thieves and assassins."</p>

<p>"Exactly," grinned James.</p>

<p>"If we weren't doing this, someone else would take our place. That's the thing with people," continued Jessie, "there's always going to be someone who's power-hungry or money-hungry or just plain vengeful who will step in to take advantage. It's human nature. So we may as well exploit it."</p>

<p>"...but 'the evils of truth and love'?" Ash queried, "There's no such thing. How can virtues be evil?"</p>

<p>"Not in and of themselves," James clarified. "Sometimes truth and love can <i>result</i> in evil."</p>

<p>"I don't see it," said Ash.</p>

<p>"Think it over, twerp," smiled Jessie, "One day you might figure out what we mean."</p><hr />

<p>Ash did think about it for the rest of the day, and when he met Giovanni again later he brought it up.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, the motto." He sounded a bit annoyed.</p>

<p>Ash pursued, "Was it written to be some kind of way of messing with the enemy or..."</p>

<p>"That was not my doing," Giovanni emphasized. "That's actually the fault of a Team Plasma general called Zinzolin, who indirectly gave my two otherwise-bright associates James and Jessie the foolhardy idea we needed some kind of rallying cry like the old Plasma war cheer."</p>

<p>"I don't really get it," Ash admitted.</p>

<p>"<i>No one</i> gets it except the minions. That shows you're meant to be a don."</p>

<p>"So I guess you wouldn't be able to tell me what they meant by 'the evils of truth and love.' "</p>

<p>Giovanni's reply was indirect. "Good and evil are two sides of the same coin. A good intention taken too far will inevitably become evil," he explained, "and one day you may find yourself standing opposite of where you started."</p>

<p>"I remember the story you told me about how Team Rocket came into being. Kind of like that?"</p>

<p>To this Giovanni was pensive. Perhaps the memory bore scars. Briefly Ash wondered if he had phrased it indelicately, or if his father would answer at all, but he leant back and replied:</p>

<p>"Exactly like that."</p>

<p>Ash still did not fully comprehend the syndicate's ideological intricacies, but he was sure of one thing: he had to learn as much as he could to get stronger, because getting stronger was the only way to both revenge what was done to Pikachu and stop Cipher from inflicting even more torture to create Shadow Pokémon.</p>

<p>He stood up to leave and Giovanni said, "Ash...you are my son. I am here for you, don't forget that."</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>Silph's logo was a stylised S in the shape of two halves of a Poké Ball. It graced the glass doors of the skyscraper, which was located in the heart of lively Saffron City and housed the company headquarters.</p>

<p>Two black vans and a limousine pulled up at the entrance. Giovanni Delavita and his two bodyguards, along with the cats Persian and Meowth, got out of the limousine. Persian gave a trill.</p>

<p>Giovanni placed a hand on his head affectionately. "Yes, my friend. Business before mealtime."</p>

<p>Out of the other cars emerged more Team Rocket members, all wearing their distinctive black uniforms. Giovanni turned to his bodyguards and ordered, "James, Jessie...as usual I expect the job be done neatly." To the others he simply said, "Let no one in or out of the premises. You have your orders."</p>

<p>Giovanni and his entourage followed by Meowth and the Persian went inside the building, where a very surprised reception desk manned by a secretary and two security guards tried protesting the intrusion. They were met swiftly with snarling Pokémon, which looked as eager to pounce as their Team Rocket trainers were to give them the go-ahead. Giovanni held them all back with a signal motion.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Silph? I believe he and I have pending negotiations he forgot to list on his itinerary," said the Team Rocket boss.</p>

<p>"Holding a meeting with the company executives," responded the secretary nervously. "He's on the eleventh floor."</p>

<p>"Well then...we'll have to vacate his schedule for him."</p>

<p>He gave a snap of his fingers and Meowth, with a meow, leapt up and snatched a card key from one of the security guards. No one dared protest.</p>

<p>Giovanni, followed by Jessie, James and the two cats went into the elevator, and swiped the card key for the eleventh floor. They could see the three Silph employees watching with uneasy knowledge as the elevator closed and whisked the Team Rocket don and admins away.</p><hr />

<p>Meanwhile, Ash was strolling down the Saffron sidewalk, on his way to the gym at last.</p>

<p>As he neared the Silph Company, he saw Giovanni's limousine parked there and two of the black-attired Team Rocket minions guarding the office building's elegant glass entrance. One of the minions was Kris; still upset about Archer's alliance with Cipher, which she knew had to have been achieved through coercion, she had thrown herself into her work for Team Rocket and succeeded in at least keeping up a cheery attitude in conversation. She smiled when Ash approached.</p>

<p>"Hi Kris. Where's my father?" Ash asked.</p>

<p>"Inside," she answered promptly. "I think he went to see the Silph Company CEO."</p>

<p>Ash glanced up at the towering skyscraper, and then peered inside the lobby where he could see more Team Rocket guards with their Pokémon. "Did...Team Rocket take over the company?"</p>

<p>"Yep," Kris affirmed. "Well, not officially; we didn't buy it yet as far as I know...but we still invaded. I get to stand guard with Bob."</p>

<p>"Hey," acknowledged Bob, the other Team Rocket agent, with a casual wave.</p>

<p>Ash mulled over the situation, and arbitrarily decided to detour from the Saffron gym. "I think I'm gonna go see what my father's up to. Catch you later Kris...and nice meeting you, Bob."</p><hr />

<p>The meeting-room was lavish, with oil paintings depicting mountain landscapes and an imported rug of a deeply burgundy hue, upon which was set a long mahogany table. Seated at the head of the conference table surrounded by six other people was Mr. Silph, who looked up in astonishment as Giovanni and his top guards strode into the corporate boardroom.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this? How did you get up here?" Silph demanded.</p>

<p>Jessie and James gave a cryptic smile; Giovanni's answer was darkly succinct.</p>

<p>"I'm here to collect a debt."</p>

<p>Silph swallowed hard, and turning to the others said, "We shall resume this meeting later. Thank you for coming."</p>

<p>The people exited the room quickly, heads down as if they knew there would be trouble. Once they had gone, Silph's attention shot back to Giovanni.</p>

<p>"You can't be serious. The mere fact you barged in here," snapped Silph. "Don't you think everybody saw you? Don't you think people downstairs saw you?"</p>

<p>"Right now your company is in the midst of a very literal takeover," Giovanni mentioned.</p>

<p>This casual remark carried a degree of offhand indifference that Silph, lacking in judicious foresight, could not begin to gauge fully.</p>

<p>"A takeover? What do you mean – a takeover?"</p>

<p>"I mean that if you would have been more attentive to corporate affairs instead of personal ones you would have noticed as of the market close I hold the majority of Silph Company stock." Giovanni did not mince words at all. "And I have agents stationed at every floor and exit preventing anyone from leaving, but that's just for my amusement."</p>

<p>He walked closer to where Silph was still seated; when he saw the man's astonishment flicker briefly into concern, Giovanni added with blunt coldness:</p>

<p>"I'm not a fool, Mr. Silph. I don't play a hand unless I know it's a winning one. And I never renege on a promise."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it you want?" asked Silph, suppressing the first tremble of unease.</p>

<p>"Payment," replied Giovanni easily. As he spoke, he retrieved the rose from the lapel pocket of his suit and tossed it to James.</p>

<p>"I intend for you to sign over the last remaining shares in the company. The Silph Company and Rocket Enterprises...no, that's woefully inaccurate." Giovanni leant forward. "By nightfall, the Silph Company will be merged with <i>Team Rocket</i>."</p>

<p>"Impossible. I won't do it," Silph declared.</p>

<p>He must have thought himself impressive, defying the don of the Team Rocket syndicate to his face. In Giovanni's sight, however, it inspired little more than petty rancour.</p>

<p>"You have a debt with me. I gave you a favor and the time has come for you to repay," Giovanni practically snarled.</p>

<p>He appeared to forcibly regain his composure, and when he spoke again his voice was eerily calm.</p>

<p>"Look, Mr. Silph...you're a smart man. I'm sure you can imagine what will happen if you say no to me now."</p>

<p>Mr. Silph stared at Giovanni, the magnitude of his words settling slowly. His eyes drifted once more to the two lithe figures who now stood on either side of him – Jessie drawing the whip taut, James holding the rose with almost kindly patience, and suddenly Mr. Silph's stately poise crumbled away into pleading terror.</p>

<p>"Mr. Delavita, <i>please</i>...!" he implored, "we can find a solution."</p>

<p>Before Giovanni could respond to him, or give a final order, Ash walked in.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Ash in his sprightly way. Pikachu, clinging to his cap, gave a corresponding squeak.</p>

<p>"The president of the Silph Company and I are discussing a vital business proposition," Giovanni said with brevity.</p>

<p>Mr. Silph did not dare open his mouth. He sat stiffly, in visible fear, with perspiration dripping down his forehead. Meanwhile Jessie and James side-eyed the intrusion with displeasure. Ash evaluated the situation in one quick review of the boardroom and his shoulders seemed to slacken.</p>

<p>"Is this really necessary, father?" Ash posed.</p>

<p>Giovanni thought about the situation and then turned back to Silph.</p>

<p>"It seems you're having a very fortunate day." His words became terse. "Enjoy it."</p>

<p>With a single motion indicating for his two employees to follow, Giovanni whirled around and left.</p><hr />

<p>Ash showed up the next morning to his father's office at Team Rocket headquarters. He appeared a bit uncertain about something as he met the Persian in the hallway and was led by it to Giovanni.</p>

<p>"Ash," Giovanni greeted him pleasantly, "<i>Buongiorno...</i> I've been told you triumphed over the Saffron gym yesterday. I don't believe I got to congratulate you."</p>

<p>Ash began tentatively. "I just heard they found Mr. Silph at the Celadon Hotel."</p>

<p>"Yes, apparently he was there meeting his mistress," said Giovanni, with the veneer of good-natured gossip.</p>

<p>"...in an elevator," Ash continued flatly, "stabbed to death, with a single red rose beside him."</p>

<p>To this, the boss of Team Rocket gave an innocuous shrug.</p>

<p>"<i>La vita è così,</i> <i>figlio mio,</i>" Giovanni smiled slightly.</p>

<p>Ash looked at him with skepticism.</p>

<p>"On a more pleasant topic," commented Giovanni, "I've heard Mr. Silph's grandson is a reasonable man and plans to sign over ownership of the entire Silph Company to Rocket Enterprises tomorrow."</p>

<p>"After what was done to his kin?" Ash was astounded.</p>

<p>"People have an innate, instinctual desire to live," said Giovanni simply. "And most are not as committed as we to the ideal, if you will, of vendettas."</p>

<p>Ash listened accordingly, but he seemed a bit ill despite himself. His gentle nature was difficult to overcome. The only thing he answered was:</p>

<p>"I need a drink."</p>

<p>"Why don't you join me for a glass of amaretto?" Giovanni replied amiably. "Or if you're going out, take Jessie and James with you. After this, the Cipher syndicate might want to hit us back."</p>

<p>He handed Ash his drink and poured one for himself. "<i>Saluté</i>," he said, and they drank.</p>

<p>Ash sat down at an armchair and asked:</p>

<p>"Why would Cipher care about that?"</p>

<p>"Because they were the ones who told Silph to not sell in the first place."</p>

<p>Ash looked mystified, and – he was forced to admit to himself later – impressed. Giovanni leant back and stroked Persian, which was purring loudly.</p>

<p>"As I said once," Giovanni added naturally, "I run a very efficient organization."</p>

<p>Mr. Rose paced up and down the living room, deep in thought and increasingly tense. Oleana and her Garbodor, a poison type Pokémon that looked almost like a trash bag, sat watching him walk to and fro. "Darling, you really shouldn't get so stressed," Oleana said, "It will be easier to think things through if you try to allay your worries."</p>

<p>"It's incomprehensible, Oleana," lamented Rose, "Giovanni seems intent on all-out war. I don't get it."</p>

<p>"Surely it would help if we opened a line of communication with Team Rocket," she considered.</p>

<p>"There's no way to reason with him." Rose shook his head as he kept pacing. "First his baseless accusations we somehow hurt his godson, followed up by an attempt to kill us both. Only two weeks later I receive word Giovanni now thinks we tried to harm his biological son. I didn't even know he <i>had</i> a son till that point. Now Mr. Silph is dead...and with him goes our last independent supplier of Poké Balls."</p>

<p>Oleana had to admit the setback that posed. "It was always unfortunate we had to outsource production of a product we once manufactured ourselves."</p>

<p>"...and we know," added Rose, "that trying to open our own business to rival Giovanni's new monopoly will be faced with all manner of retaliation. What bothers me is how he won't just admit he doesn't want competition...he has to shroud it in all these lies, acting as if we're going after his kinfolk to justify his actions as a vendetta."</p>

<p>He sat down wearily on the loveseat beside her as Garbodor hopped onto the floor to give them room. "At this point, I don't know what to do," he admitted.</p>

<p>Oleana narrowed her eyes pensively at the same time as Mayor E. S. Cade walked in. His normally formal attire looked dishevelled and tarnished with soot, and it caused Rose to have a double-take.</p>

<p>"Cade, what happened? You look awful," Rose remarked.</p>

<p>"You know the laboratory where we had the equipment to produce Shadow Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>"It burnt to the ground."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, the laboratory <i>burnt to the ground</i>?"</p>

<p>"Team Rocket did it."</p>

<p>"My God, that place took a small fortune to build, not to mention the scientific equipment, and now it's literally up in smoke."</p>

<p>"...as well as all our remaining crates of Poké Balls!" Oleana added.</p>

<p>Cade looked red in the face. "Your building was technically on regional land, allocated towards the Phenac City revitalization. How do you think it makes me look?"</p>

<p>"Inept," snapped Rose.</p>

<p>"No, corrupt," Cade countered.</p>

<p>"Which you are," Rose answered with a scowl, "It's not like you ever tried to hide that."</p>

<p>Cade forced down his ire with a slow breath, and manufactured his usual charm. "Look, Mr. Rose, bickering will get us nowhere. It's those hoodlums from Team Rocket that have to pay – both for your property damage and my public pride."</p>

<p>"What are you proposing?" asked Rose dubiously.</p>

<p>"Hit them back, hard," Cade emphasized, "None of the niceties from when we tried to recover the Mew; it got us nowhere. If they want a war with Cipher, let's go all out."</p>

<p>"It'd be a massacre!"</p>

<p>"That's evidently what they want, and for no reason at all... It's clear Team Rocket won't stay on their territory even if you try to stand down."</p>

<p>Oleana spoke with frosty skepticism. "You're overly eager to go to war with Giovanni...as usual."</p>

<p>"With all he's been doing, I believe it's merited," Cade replied, and turned to Rose. "We've still got the Shadow Pokémon we produced; we can use them in battle. With their type resistance, even Team Rocket's high-level Pokémon won't stand a chance."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, someone told me Giovanni thinks we're collecting Legendary Pokémon or something to that regard," Rose commented. "He knows Oleana owns Zacian and Zamazenta, but he seems to think we've captured a Raikou, and right from his territory."</p>

<p>"Oh...I wouldn't know anything about that," Cade responded. "More of his lies no doubt."</p>

<p>"No doubt," smirked Rose. "I'll think over what we do. Starting with our batch of Shadow Pokémon; they may be astonishingly powerful, but the procedure obviously left them in distress, so we'll have to find a way to alleviate what the energy beam did to them." The displeased look on Cade's face to hear this did not go unnoticed by Rose, but it did go politely unaddressed. "You'd better get yourself cleaned up too," he added when he saw Garbodor waddle over to Cade's side, attracted as only a poison type could be by his dingy suit.</p>

<p>When the Phenac City mayor had left, Rose turned aside to speak with Oleana again. "If there was any doubt about your suspicions, my dear Oleana, I think Cade himself is dispelling them. Heaven knows we'd have ample reason to want war with Team Rocket, considering Giovanni's theft of our former company, but Cade seems to want it more than we do. Perhaps enough to stir the pot in secret. Now...<i>why</i>?"</p><hr />

<p>Destroying Cipher's laboratory would merely be the beginning. Now that Silph was out of the way and Team Rocket owned a monopoly on Poké Ball manufacturing, Giovanni could focus all his attention on Cipher. If Rose wanted war, and really – interfering in Team Rocket's capture of Mew, the mystery behind Archer's defection, and trying to kill Ash; and Rose brazenly denying all of it – there could be no other explanation, save that he wanted a war.</p>

<p>First thing was first, though. They needed to get Archer back.</p>

<p>So after James, Jessie, and Meowth contacted Giovanni, telling him how they'd succeeded in his orders and the Cipher laboratory was in flames, he sent them posthaste to the Under. If there was a chance to track down Archer, it would no doubt come to the forefront there.</p>

<p>The Team Rocket trio walked till they found a flickering neon sign above a doorway that read: The Under Grand Hotel. They went in and saw a door to the side that had a symbol that appeared to be a bottle drawn on it.</p>

<p>Opening the door, they found a staircase leading to a cellar, and they followed it downstairs. It led them to an entrance of a liquor vendor. James was eyeing the place suspiciously.</p>

<p>"This is a seedy place," he decided.</p>

<p>Meowth let out a hiss. "What do you care? We’ve been to seedy places before."</p>

<p>Jessie concurred, "Yeah, but this is seedy even by our standards."</p>

<p>Meowth added, "Let’s go in and wait for our contact to arrive."</p>

<p>They wandered in virtually unnoticed, since most of the people there were keeping themselves low key as well, and sat at a corner table. A bartender walked over.</p>

<p>"What can I get you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered James, "We’re waiting for someone, and don’t expect to be here for very long."</p>

<p>"Makes no difference to me," the man answered gruffly, "Everyone here is either waiting for someone, something, or already 'doing business' …either way, you order or you get out."</p>

<p>"Nice attitude," hissed Meowth.</p>

<p>"Bring us a beer," replied Jessie.</p>

<p>"Just one?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, just one!" screamed Jessie, "You said to order, you didn’t say it had to be more than one, or if we had to actually consume your stinking drinks!"</p>

<p>This outburst momentarily made people look their way, but everyone knew better than to get involved in what was not their business. The bartender left quickly and returned just as fast with one beer, which he set before them.</p>

<p>Jessie promptly took the beer glass, poured the beer on the floor and putting the glass back on the table looked the man straight in the eyes and said, "Now leave us alone, before I let my Team Rocket boss know that you are most uncooperative."</p>

<p>Meowth added a hiss.</p>

<p>The bartender left without another word, and the trio was left waiting for the business partner to show up. They sat there for about a half hour and then they saw their contact, a man called Miror B.</p>

<p>He was quite unmistakable in a crowd. He was dressed in a showy gold suit, with his red-and-white hair styled in an afro, and wearing large sunglasses for looks – the Under was certainly dark as it was, to merit them. As soon as he sat down, Miror B. wasted no time in speaking.</p>

<p>"I have to get back to the club; I'm on stage in an hour."</p>

<p>Jessie tossed a couple of cash bills onto the table, which Miror B. wasted no time in snatching up. "...but I might be able to stop the music long enough to have a conversation with such a charming couple and their kitty-cat."</p>

<p>"We're flattered," Jessie replied, bored.</p>

<p>"Look, short and sweet. We're trying to find someone," said James, who produced an up-to-date photograph of Archer. Miror B. scrutinized it before affirming:</p>

<p>"Short teal hair, blue eyes, always with a strict kind of formality? Yeah, I've seen him. He hangs around with E. S. Cade as muscle. I don't know where he goes off-duty, though. He could be living under a false name."</p>

<p>"Could you find out?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it."</p>

<p>Jessie tossed another bill of cash onto the table, but this time Miror B. shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know better than to accept advance payment from Team Rocket when I can't provide the goods," he said. "If there was a way to find out without putting my hide on the line, I'd have info already from my contacts in Cipher...but many people, in particular those who'd know, because they worked at the Cipher lab alongside Cade, are too afraid to talk. They say Cade's got a Pokémon that isn't a Pokémon."</p>

<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" asked James. Miror B. shrugged.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, it's scared everyone who knows into silence. And I'm not particularly keen to find out what they mean either."</p>

<p>When Miror B. left, Jessie, James, and Meowth lingered in a huddle.</p>

<p>Jessie spoke first. "Okay guys. Riddle me this...what kind of Pokémon, isn't a Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"A Bidoof," declared Meowth.</p>

<p>Jessie practically rolled her eyes. "Serious answers only, Meowth, not your own prejudice."</p>

<p>"But those damn woodchucks are <i>evil</i>," the cat hissed.</p>

<p>James ignored Meowth. "Suppose Cade caught something obscenely powerful. We know Cipher already owns a Raikou, and no one's seen Entei roaming the Johto region anymore so it's safe to say they've got Entei too... What if now they've got something even more fearsome; something so strong it's beyond what people normally think of with regard to Pokémon?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he's caught the missing Mew?" considered Jessie.</p>

<p>"Maybe he turned it into a 'Shadow' Mew," James replied.</p>

<p>"Cat-astrophe," growled Meowth.</p>

<p>"We don't even know what a damn Mew looks like. Archer knew," Jessie lamented, then realized, "Wait...didn't Kris help him catch it?"</p>

<p>"We oughta ask her," Meowth alerted his ears. "At least we'll have an idea what kind of critter we're even talking about."</p>

<p>"It could only help," agreed James. "Let's get back to the Pyrite Motel...Kris is probably getting restless there anyway waiting for us."</p><hr />

<p>It was dawn, and the sun was steadily creeping higher in the sky. Kris poised cautiously on the roof of the Mart and adjusted her binoculars, her post affording her a clear view of Phenac City Hall across the street.</p>

<p>She should have been back at the motel in Pyrite Town. She'd come along with the trio of Jessie, James, and Meowth to train some more and be a backup fighter with Suicune, not to go off on a solo search-and-rescue mission.</p>

<p>But her own desperation to find her brother finally got the better of her.</p>

<p>Beside her, Eevee looked up at her and squeaked.</p>

<p>"They won't be too pissed," Kris answered her Pokémon's question, "not if we come back with a lead on Archer's whereabouts."</p>

<p>Eevee's long ears lay flat. It didn't seem to share her certainty, but it would stand by its trainer regardless.</p>

<p>City Hall was relatively quiet. At this early hour, with the sun still an increasing glow in the sky, the offices were closed and no one had arrived to work yet. She was going over a plan in her mind as she studied the building and the possible ways in.</p>

<p>"Okay Eevee," she announced at last, lowering the binoculars, "we're going to sneak into City Hall and find the mayor's office. The last time anyone saw Archer was with Cade, right? And Cade was apparently the same person in charge of those Cipher guards back at the laboratory."</p>

<p>Eevee tipped its head to one side attentively.</p>

<p>"We're going to get into the mayor's office and see if there's anything he's got there that could tell us something we don't know."</p>

<p>It was a long-shot; Kris knew that, but she figured it was the best chance they had. She knew Jessie, James, and Meowth thought a contact of theirs in the Under would know something, and perhaps he did, but in her mind it seemed a far more effective plan of action to go investigate who she presumed was the heart of the issue – and that was Cade himself.</p>

<p>Kris hurriedly brought the binoculars back up to her eyes when she saw a black car arrive, and the driver get out and head for City Hall.</p>

<p>It was none other than Mayor E. S. Cade.</p>

<p>She hadn't expected him so early. Nevertheless, that wouldn't be a problem for her; if anything it was a bonus.</p>

<p>"Change of plans..." decided Kris, "we're sneaking in and confronting Cade."</p><hr />

<p>He generally came to the office much later, but Cade had an urgency to get something he kept there. If Mr. Rose would still not be spurred into action, then perhaps he'd have to help the war along a bit.</p>

<p>It didn't matter if Rose or Giovanni was the first to go down. Granted, he'd hoped it would be Giovanni, because he had his own personal dislike for the Delavitas, but his aim would be fulfilled regardless. It was nonetheless preferable they wear each other down; he would have an easier time taking over the surviving group if it was weakened from fighting, and seeing Rose's Cipher was hesitant in getting involved at all, he'd have to restructure his plans and wear Team Rocket out another way.</p>

<p>Within his office he had one of the radio systems with which he could contact those loyal to him in Team Rocket. It was through that system he had gathered them together to assist in kidnapping Ash. He would contact his infiltrates and have them strike at Team Rocket – from the inside.</p>

<p>Cade smirked at the thought. It was a perfect ploy! Team Rocket knew they had enemy agents embedded in their ranks, but they'd been unable to weed them out. What they didn't know was how many of them were assigned to the Viridian gym.</p>

<p>It would be the first time in Kanto's history that a League gym would be ransacked and its gym leader assassinated on-site. <i>First time for everything,</i> Cade thought with malicious contentment.</p>

<p>His good mood vanished upon stepping into his office.</p>

<p>He was confronted by a woman in the black uniform of a Team Rocket recruit. Her Eevee poised in a battle stance with fur fluffed out, growling and ready to shoot its attacks directly at him.</p>

<p>"Shut the door," she ordered simply.</p>

<p>He slowly did. The silence was devastating. "My, my..." began Cade, "I must be honest...I never imagined anyone would go so far. A Team Rocket agent, entering my own office!"</p>

<p>"You can quit the sanctimony," snapped Kris, "I know you're involved with Cipher."</p>

<p>Cade did not dispute it. She went on, "I'm here to find out where my brother is."</p>

<p>"...who?" he feigned ignorance.</p>

<p>"Archer Verdi!" Kris countered. "You must know where he is. You were with him at the power plant."</p>

<p>"You're evidently mistaken," said Cade tentatively.</p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes as she pulled out a Poké Ball. "If you don't tell me where Archer is the nice way, my Suicune will get it out of you the nasty way."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have a Suicune?" Cade asked with visible interest.</p>

<p>Kris hesitated, suddenly aware she might have spoken a bit too much. Cade was as demure as ever. "I don't think you want to battle me."</p>

<p>"I don't think <i>you</i> want to face my Suicune."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the principle of the matter." He gave a slight shrug. "Trainers' eyes locked; that sort of sentiment? I know Johto's customs too from when I lived there years ago. It's a point of honor." Retrieving a Poké Ball from his pocket and unlocking it, Cade added:</p>

<p>"Who am I to turn down a challenge?"</p>

<p>He opened the Poké Ball with the press of a button.</p>

<p>Archer emerged from the capsule in a flash of white light, standing attentively. And Kris, taken completely by shock, could only blink and stare in stunned horror.</p>

<p>"Get that Poké Ball!" ordered Cade.</p>

<p>Archer sprang at her, wresting Suicune's Poké Ball away and pushing her aside. Cade meanwhile had opened another Poké Ball, and Houndoom was sent out. With a set of hand signals, too swift for Kris to properly detect, Houndoom directed its attention to Eevee and with a pounce sank its fangs into the small creature's pelt. Eevee squealed as it was hurled sideways against the wall, knocked out.</p>

<p>Archer handed the stolen Poké Ball to Cade without a trace of emotion. Cade snickered as he regarded the still-locked sphere containing Suicune.</p>

<p>"The last of the three Legendary Beasts. I must thank you for such a generous donation to my campaign," Cade taunted. "...of conquest, that is."</p>

<p>Kris managed to recall the hurt Eevee to its Poké Ball, feeling sick to her stomach. This had been a disaster. She should have stayed in the motel. She had never planned for this turn of events...and she never would have imagined what she'd just witnessed either, her brother being commanded from a Poké Ball like an animal. She was now left without useable Pokémon, facing down both Archer and Houndoom, neither of whom showed any form of recognition. Archer spoke before she did.</p>

<p>"Don't try to fight. It won't do you any good."</p>

<p>"You can't listen to him!" Kris exclaimed, "What he's doing will bring down our syndicate."</p>

<p>"Not bring down – lift into glory!" Archer replied with conviction, "We're weakening Team Rocket's power only enough to <em>refashion</em> it. I plan to create an even stronger Team Rocket, to regain our former glory under the leadership of a new don."</p>

<p>"Yourself," she echoed, with comprehension. "Archer you've been lied to. Don't you recognize me?"</p>

<p>Cade broke in, addressing Archer. "Don't pay her any mind. This pretty young lady is one of your misguided former coworkers, sent here to prevent us from achieving our mission."</p>

<p>"Archer..." she emphasized, "I'm your sister."</p>

<p>Archer wavered a bit; Kris noticed it. Cade frowned. "Enough! Don't embarrass yourself, Archer!" He made the swiftest motion with his hand, a signal.</p>

<p>To which Archer's voice became terse as he addressed Kris. "I won't allow you to interfere with our plans."</p>

<p>His eyes were cold, and almost empty of everything save a fixed darkness. Her body felt a chill, and she took two steps backward. Instinctively, she knew she was in trouble. The look in his face was one she had seen before...before he was about to kill.</p>

<p>With a single signal, Houndoom leapt at Kris with its fangs bared. She tried to fend off Houndoom with her whip, but the dog succeeded at last in snapping its jaws on the lash and snatching it away from her. Out of the corner of her eye, Kris could see Archer watching this play out inscrutably.</p>

<p>Disarmed, Kris fled, sprinting up a spiral metal stairwell as fast as she could with the drum of Archer's steps close behind her. She emerged onto the roof, where she found escape barred on all sides by a steep drop. The desert's rugged wilderness stretched towards the faraway peaks of Mt. Battle and their jagged etchings upon the horizon, and daylight – brilliant morning sunshine, which bestowed jarringly scenic beauty upon her stage of violent peril.</p>

<p>She turned to see Archer standing at a distance, at the rooftop exit she had come from. He now advanced; she backed away, taking one step too far.</p>

<p>Height begot a naturally wild wind and as her heel reached the edge of the building, Kris lost her balance in a gust and fell; by a miracle, she managed to grasp hold of a flagpole, saving herself narrowly from the earth miles down.</p>

<p>It seemed like centuries in a full minute. She clinging desperately to the flagpole, he gazing down with conflicted impatience, and suddenly, as if remorse had softened his heart, he reached for her.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand."</p>

<p>Even now, Kris hesitated.</p>

<p>"Quickly!" Archer exhorted her, "give me your hand."</p>

<p>Kris reached gingerly for him, at the same time Archer seized her hand with his, and she abandoned the flagpole for her brother.</p>

<p>Yet in that same instant his eyes betrayed a darker motive, a sinister reality of purpose.</p>

<p>Realization dawned upon her as she said, "You really don't remember."</p>

<p>He smiled back subtly. "You really thought I cared."</p>

<p>And he let her go.</p>

<p>Cade recalled Houndoom and deposited all the Poké Balls in his desk drawer, including the one containing Suicune, but sent out his Espeon. The lithe Eevee evolution appeared with a cry.</p>

<p>"Just in case," Cade told it.</p>

<p>Espeon twitched an ear but responded nothing.</p>

<p>He headed briskly up to the rooftop, followed by his Pokémon, and arrived in time to see Archer drop Kris from the building.</p>

<p>Cade walked over to the edge of the roof and peered down. Below, he could see the city banner fluttering fitfully where it had been partially torn from the flagpole, and Kris lying motionless on the ground.</p>

<p>"It's only one story down. She might've survived," said Cade, handing Archer a pistol. "Go make sure she didn't."</p>

<p>Archer took the weapon.</p>

<p>Kris was passed out, but she was indeed still breathing as he approached. Archer unflinchingly aimed the gun point-blank for the <i>coup de grâce</i>...and then took notice of something.</p>

<p>Beside her, some of her possessions had spilled out onto the ground; Eevee's locked Poké Ball, a small medicinal Potion, and...a photograph. The moment Archer laid eyes on the image, he froze. Slowly, he bent down to pick it up.</p>

<p>It was a familiar image; he didn't know why, at first. There was a woman, with an infant and a boy of nearly five in age. With it came the shiver of a recollection...two people at National Park – yes, that was the name, the park in Johto – and they had found something they'd both lost...and one was he, and the other was...</p>

<p>Archer's throat went dry.</p>

<p>Cade fidgeted restlessly as he stared down at his slave. "What are you waiting for, damn it? Shoot!"</p>

<p>Archer only regarded the image with a kind of dumbstruck horror, and when he glanced with the same horror at the unconscious Kris, and took a shaky step backwards, only then did Cade begin to comprehend what had happened. The Shadow process was not infallible. If brainwashing successfully closed the door to his heart, or that of any of the Pokémon, memories could reopen it.</p>

<p>He reached into his pocket only to be hit with dismay upon finding it empty. He'd left Archer's Poké Ball in his desk, meaning he had no way to reach it fast enough to recall his prisoner.</p>

<p>At that instant, Cade realized the game was up.</p>

<p>All Archer's distraught understanding evolved, in a flash, into a spirit of revenge, and he spun around to shoot Cade. Cade commanded Espeon faster with a thought:</p>

<p>
  <i>Zap Cannon.</i>
</p>

<p>Espeon hurled its fiery electric attack directly at Archer, the ball of lightning striking squarely. The gun fell from his grip as Archer, crying out in pain, collapsed. When he tried to pull himself up and reach for where it had fallen, Espeon attacked yet again, and this time Archer fainted.</p>

<p>Cade's expression contorted into a smirk. Now he only had to ensure they were dead...</p>

<p>He descended from the rooftop and hurried to where they lay unconscious, Espeon trailing after him.</p>

<p>"Hyper Beam," Cade ordered.</p>

<p>Espeon pulled back obediently, and as Cade watched it charging the lethal attack, he heard two familar people shout:</p>

<p>"Copperajah, Protect!"</p>

<p>"Garbodor, Acid Spray!"</p>

<p>He glanced up in time to see two Pokémon spring. Espeon leapt back as the trash bag Pokémon Garbodor lifted its arms and unleashed an aimed dart of poison liquid; acid seared narrowly past and Espeon yelped as it cut across its fur, its Hyper Beam faltering into harmless sparks. Meanwhile, the steel type elephant Copperajah barred their way to defend the injured siblings, sending forth an energy barrier as a shield.</p>

<p>Hurrying right behind the Pokémon were their trainers, Oleana and Rose. Alongside them in turn were a small group of five or six guards with violet neckerchiefs. Seeing the guards open Poké Balls of their own to send their creatures on the attack, Cade dashed back into City Hall to his office.</p>

<p>He scarcely imagined he could run as fast as he did then. Espeon followed at his heels as he practically leapt to the desk, yanking open the drawer and snatching up all the Poké Balls, able to hear his former allies racing to seize him.</p>

<p>Rose and Oleana burst in at that moment to see Cade standing next to Espeon. The Pokémon faced the intruders and growled.</p>

<p>"Teleport," ordered Cade.</p>

<p>Espeon gave a cry, and with a whisk of its forked tail both it and its trainer were warped away.</p>

<p>"Of all the inexcusable...!" exclaimed Oleana, "How did he even teach his Espeon the move Teleport?"</p>

<p>Rose shook his head. "It doesn't matter. We've got a bigger issue at hand."</p>

<p>They returned outside, where the guards and their Pokémon were protecting the seemingly lifeless Kris and Archer. One of the men addressed Rose.</p>

<p>"They're alive sir, but both are out cold and badly hurt."</p>

<p>"It's still early enough that no one else is here to be a witness, but that won't last," contemplated Oleana.</p>

<p>"Two injured," Rose added thoughtfully, "one a uniformed Team Rocket agent... The authorities will ask questions." He and Oleana exchanged a glance, and with wordless agreement Rose turned back to his guards.</p>

<p>"Take them to our property here in Phenac City."</p><hr />

<p>Kris woke up groggily, finding herself lying in a bed. Her muscles ached tremendously.</p>

<p>Recollections of what had happened at City Hall took a moment to return, and as Kris was going over them in her mind and trying to collect her bearings she glanced over to see a Chansey, which gave a cheerful cry to see her awake.</p>

<p>Having alerted its trainer, Chansey was soon joined by a lady wearing the familiar nurse's uniform from the Pokémon Center. Kris knew she wasn't in the Pokémon Center's lodge, however; this place looked more like the guest bedroom of a large house. "...Where am I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You're at Mr. and Mrs. Rose's place here in Phenac City," came the prompt answer.</p>

<p>Kris let this sink in; she initially thought this meant she was a prisoner of Cipher, till the nurse elaborated in a friendly way:</p>

<p>"They saved you and your brother from Cade. You were both badly injured, but you'll be fine now...Your brother is in the next room."</p>

<p>"Aren't you one of the nurses from the Pokémon Center?"</p>

<p>"The Roses are acquaintances of mine," she explained, "They needed to get someone here with medical knowledge and a healer Pokémon on short notice...someone who wouldn't run to the authorities when they saw the patients."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see my brother," said Kris; as she tried to sit up, she felt a momentary dizziness and had to lie down again. "<i>Ohhhh</i>...that's bad," she groaned.</p>

<p>The nurse checked her blood pressure and said, "You can get up but slowly." She helped Kris get up from bed. "He's right next door. You can go now if you feel better; I'll be in there in a few minutes," added the nurse as she left the room.</p>

<p>Kris stumbled her way to the door and walked out to an elegant hallway. She saw the room next to her had the door ajar and a light on so she knocked. No answer. She walked in and saw her brother Archer lying in bed, either asleep or unconscious.</p>

<p>She sat down at a seat next to him and let her mind wander. So many thoughts passed through her head; she felt sad that she couldn't do more to help. Suddenly, Archer stirred.</p>

<p>"Archer! Archer!" she called him in a loud voice, "It's me, Kris... Archer!"</p>

<p>Archer opened his eyes and Kris felt such joy as she hadn't felt in a long time. "Thank God! You're awake!" she exclaimed, "We were rescued by Mr. and Mrs. Rose."</p>

<p>Archer groaned. "I feel like shit."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know," agreed Kris. "...my body hurts all over."</p>

<p>"Kris, I'm so sorry...I never wanted you to get hurt."</p>

<p>"It's not your fault."</p>

<p>They were quiet for a while and Kris broke the silence, "I find it amazing that it was the Roses who came to our rescue... seems we were wrong all along about their involvement in your abduction."</p>

<p>Archer sighed, "I realized it at some point when they came to see Cade. I was inside that damn Poké Ball and they couldn't hear me yelling out but I could hear everything they were discussing."</p>

<p>At that point, the nurse walked in followed by Mr. Rose and his wife Oleana. "Good to see you're awake," Mr. Rose said.</p>

<p>"The nurse said your prognosis is good," added Oleana, "You will be well enough to travel soon."</p>

<p>"Thank you...both." Archer said, "Has Giovanni been notified of what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Rose, "I've called and spoken to him...he will arrive as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"He's eager to see you and Kris," said Oleana, smiling at them both.</p><hr />

<p>Giovanni would be getting there by dusk, and Jessie, James, and Meowth would be meeting him at the airport; giving some time for Kris and Archer to spend recuperating. The more active of the two was decidedly Kris, who didn't leave the premises but made it a point to get up and walk about.</p>

<p>Archer, in contrast, remained in the bedroom all day. He didn't feel well enough to get up, but he was mostly just pensive and wanted to reflect on everything that had transpired. Some part of him held a secret fear that his rescue was a dream, or that these amenities would be taken from him. He'd forgotten the softness and warmth of blankets and pillows; resting in a bed had become a luxury, a priceless one he barely recollected. Yet he still had a sort of inexplicable emotional numbness, which did not cease to be unusual to him.</p>

<p>He glanced up to see Kris appear at the entryway with a tray in her hands. "I brought you food."</p>

<p>Archer gazed at her for a moment and sighed. "Kris, you don't have to coddle me like I'm a newly hatched Pokémon."</p>

<p>"You're injured, remember." She sat down beside the bed. "Besides, you haven't eaten or drunk anything in hours. You should have breakfast."</p>

<p>On a lark he glanced at the clock on the nightstand. "It's almost dinnertime."</p>

<p>"It's breakfast for you. You're breaking a fast."</p>

<p>Archer could not deny that; it was as simplistic a justification as it was logical. He was hungry too, though he hadn't said so and likely would have denied it, and the food smelled delicious.</p>

<p>"I know the laboratory was destroyed," Archer chatted as he ate, "but Cade spoke as if he had some sort of plan in the works. He still has my Houndoom...and now he has your Suicune. He's got all three Legendary Beasts."</p>

<p>"From what I heard, Giovanni's got a Charizard that's almost as strong as a Legendary," replied Kris.</p>

<p>"That Charizard was stolen on one of Jessie and James' missions and doesn't listen to anyone."</p>

<p>"There's got to be a way to get our Pokémon back."</p>

<p>He wished he could share her optimism. "Even if we get them back, Cade has a way of forcing Pokémon and people to change beyond even their own recognition...and making it seem as if it was their choice all along. Houndoom is a Shadow Pokémon now. As for myself...I don't think I've ever felt so vulnerable."</p>

<p>It was only now as Archer truly reflected on it when the depth of Cade's dominion slowly began sinking in. Frailty lowered his voice to nearly a whisper. "They really could have made me do anything they wanted."</p>

<p>"Archer. ...Archer, listen to me. It's all right."</p>

<p>His breath felt tight, and it was only when she spoke that he realized his hands were trembling. He exhaled deeply, trying to force himself back to the peace of the present. When he met his sister's eyes, the same mild blue of his own, she smiled.</p>

<p>"It's safe in here, but not out there," Archer told her. "He can still get me any time I'm in range of that Poké Ball."</p>

<p>He looked embarrassed by the thought, and Kris piped up, "That's nothing to be ashamed of. You're a victim."</p>

<p>"Pfft – <i>victim</i>; as if I'm helpless or some shit. I'm going to make Cade pay for putting me through this humiliation..." As Archer spoke his eyes flashed with blue fire, and he tried to sit up more only to wince and reluctantly lie back down. "...as soon as I recover a bit," he relented.</p>

<p>"We'll tell Giovanni. Team Rocket owns all the Poké Ball manufacturers now. He's got to know a way to release you without having access to the Poké Ball in question."</p>

<p>"Something's happened to me during that captivity," Archer went on. "It feels like there's a constant emptiness of feeling. At one moment it's as if my emotions are gone, then they'll come in a flood..."</p>

<p>A third person broke into their conversation from the entrance. "All the Shadow Pokémon are like that."</p>

<p>They glanced up as Oleana stepped in, and she elaborated, her tone hinting at a kind of resignation to the findings, "In the Pokémon, the sudden emotional rush usually leads to them becoming hyper-aggressive or anxious, so we've taken to calling it Hyper Mode."</p>

<p>"How do you reverse it?" asked Kris.</p>

<p>"The process was experimental," Oleana told her, "and specifically targeted neurons with the intent of altering them. Granted the emotional changes were a side effect, and it was certainly never intended to be used on a human, but on Pokémon the idea was to <i>irreversibly</i> change their elemental..."</p>

<p>"Wait...what are you saying?" Kris interjected.</p>

<p>"One thing is emotional trauma...another thing is the neurological effect of the energy ray, which unfortunately amounts to brain damage." Oleana's gaze softened, but she spoke as straightforward as ever as she faced Archer. "I'm sorry...neither you nor any of the Shadow Pokémon might ever fully recover."</p>

<p>For a long moment, the two siblings just stared at Oleana. Then Kris wrapped her arms around Archer in a tight hug. "My poor brother...!"</p>

<p>"Let go of me," Archer snapped, trying to wriggle free.</p>

<p>Kris did not. "How could they do this to you?"</p>

<p>"Help I'm getting smothered," he protested.</p>

<p>Kris released her grip on him and turned again towards Oleana. "Wait a second, Oleana...wasn't there a myth about Mew, which said it could heal any kind of injury?" Kris persisted.</p>

<p>"I believe so," Oleana replied.</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't it heal what happened to Archer and all the Shadow Pokémon?"</p>

<p>Oleana looked visibly interested in the idea, although as she thought it over, this tempered reluctantly into ambivalence upon hitting the evident roadblock:</p>

<p>"First someone has to find Mew."</p>
