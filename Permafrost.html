<p>Wind howled across the tundra, blowing clouds of snow caught in its unforgiving grasp. They twirled like smoke in the dry, cold atmosphere; like leaping, ancient spirits.</p>

<p>The sound of snow crunching underpaw signaled the arrival of a lone arctic fox, who paused momentarily at the top of an icy knoll. Glancing around the harsh landscape, he plunged down to the flatter yet still snow-strewn land below. Here he stopped again, his small ears pricking up.</p>

<p><em>Could it be? After so long?</em> Tensing his body, he crouched down into the snow - then leapt headlong into it. He dug around hopefully, then sat up with a discouraged look on his face. "Nothing!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Did you find anything?" The voice of his mate made him turn; he spied her sitting atop the hill, watching him.</p>

<p>"No..." he replied, then trying to sound optimistic, "But we will."</p>

<p>"This has been one of the cruelest winters we have faced." his mate sighed, as she leapt down to join him. "The lemmings are gone...and now those..." She shuddered, and broke off; the male fox tried to reassure her.</p>

<p>"This will not be the first famine - or the last - that we foxes will have faced. As for the danger, we'll find some way to survive." They touched noses and he flicked his tail as a signal for them to head back.</p>

<p>The pair trudged across the barren territory, silent and uneasy; the stabbing, hollow pain of hunger making each pawstep an effort. They were climbing up a glacier, only a few paces away from their den, when the vixen let out a shrill cry.</p>

<p>"No! They found it!"</p>

<p>Surrounding the den entrance were three dangerous-looking humans who seemed preoccupied with their work. Upon hearing the animals, one whipped around sharply to lock eyes with the male fox.</p>

<p>"There!"</p>

<p>"Run!" the male fox cried, as the human lifted his rifle and fired.</p>

<p>The bullet missed by an inch; the vixen sprung up with a yelp and both dashed away. They could hear the human barking orders to the others and quick footsteps in pursuit.</p>

<p>The two foxes fled across the tundra and skidding at a turn, whipped up snow. A second shot was fired; then a third. The foxes' rapid, terrified run soon found them on an ice sheet. There was a piercing noise as one of the bullets cracked the ice; jagged lines splintered across the glassy reflection. In a matter of seconds, the two foxes leapt to solid ground just before another shot broke the frozen water into pieces with a horrifying crash; then the female fox exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The timberline!"</p>

<p>It was their only hope, their only salvation. The male took the lead as the pair flew towards the faraway line of pine forest. Shots rang out around them, spraying snow into the freezing air...the foxes fearing that every bound would be their last...and then...</p>

<p>The two foxes plunged into the bracken. It shivered momentarily with the impact, and grew still. The foxes panted with fear and exertion as they watched their pursuers approach, searching for them. They prayed their beautiful white pelts, their camouflage in the snow, would not betray them to the humans.</p>

<p>Their hearts pounded as the three men crept up slowly, gripping their rifles in tightly clenched hands. They scanned the bushes and at last, the one who had fired on the foxes first, once again spoke.</p>

<p>"Damn those foxes. We lost them."</p>

<p>As the humans retreated, the critters kept perfectly still until they were out of sight. Finally, the male fox breathed a shaky sigh of relief, then turned to his mate, his voice soft.</p>

<p>"We're safe...for now."</p>

<p>Above, the aurora danced in the dark arctic sky. Celestial beauty, an ironic backdrop to a frozen hell...</p><h3>Chapter 1 - News Trio</h3>

<p><em>"Breaking News! I'm Samantha West coming to you live from the scene of a raging apartment fire in Estrella City, where - as you can see behind me - firefighters are struggling to put out the blaze. Authorities tell us that the fire started at 10 a.m. this morning, on the top floor, and that everyone managed to get out safely. The cause of the fire is still unknown...We'll be keeping you updated on any developments...For now, reporting live from Estrella City, Samantha West, WCAT 8 News."</em></p>

<p>~</p>

<p>"And...cut!"</p>

<p>TV reporter Samantha Verity West brushed away the earpiece and glanced over at her cameraman, David Candid. She smiled. "I think that came out pretty good," she remarked.</p>

<p>"You always are," Dave replied. "We'd better start getting ready for our noon broadcast," he added with a glance at his watch. "It's in half an hour."</p>

<p>"You're right," Samantha agreed. "Boy, am I hungry! I wonder if there's any place to eat around here?"</p>

<p>"I packed some ham sandwiches for us," said Dave, as the two strolled toward the back of the van. There was a cool, refreshing breeze coming in from the ocean, typical here in the Caribbean where Tropical Island was located; yet it did nothing to quench the fire, which despite the attempts of firemen, still burned fiercely in the warmth of the tropical sun.</p>

<p>Samantha Verity West and David Candid worked for WCAT channel 8 on Tropical Island. Samantha was a general-assignment news reporter; Dave was a photo-journalist and regularly paired up with Samantha as her cameraman, most especially since they had established a personal relationship.</p>

<p>They were both in their mid-to-late twenties. Samantha was slender, with vivid green eyes and short brunette hair with shaggy bangs, and almost always wore formal office attire. Dave was muscular, with short, tousled dark brown hair and brown eyes, and dressed casually.</p>

<p>"Hopefully they'll have that blaze extinguished soon." Samantha was commenting as her partner slid open the back door. "I'd like to interview the fire chief..."</p>

<p>"Hi guys!" A familiar meow broke into her conversation; reporter and cameraman both glanced down in surprise to see...</p>

<p>"<em>Geronimo</em>!" they exclaimed in unison.</p>

<p>The slim tomcat ignored the disbelief in their eyes. "Man, that was so cool!" he purred happily. "I love the way you can keep your voice so even on the air. I saw it all on your tiny TVs here," Geronimo continued, flicking his tail at the numerous monitors inside the satellite van. "Say, what's the point of having so many TVs?"</p>

<p>"Geronimo, what are you <em>doing</em> here?" Samantha was still in shock.</p>

<p>"So much for lunch," Dave sighed, looking past Geronimo to the crumpled wrappers thrown on the van floor.</p>

<p>"Oh." Geronimo glanced over his shoulder. "That was yours?"</p>

<p>"Geronimo..." Samantha said, trying to maintain calm, "What on earth are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Oh man, it's so boring at home; you have <em>no idea</em>." Geronimo quickly explained. "I want some adventure; excitement, like <em>you</em> guys!"</p>

<p>"So... you decided to follow us?" Samantha said incredulously.</p>

<p>"Well, yeah!"</p>

<p>"But did you have to eat our food?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"It was just sitting there and I was hungry" Geronimo protested.</p>

<p>"The sandwiches are besides the point," said Samantha. "You snuck into our van and traveled halfway across Tropical Island with us because you were <em>bored</em>?!"</p>

<p>Before the cat had time to answer, Dave's cell phone rang. "Hello. Dave Candid speaking. Yes sir. I'll tell her. Thank you."</p>

<p>He hung up and looked at Samantha.</p>

<p>"Ted Hughes," she said. Dave nodded.</p>

<p>"Let me guess..." Samantha continued. "We'll be first on the air, right?"</p>

<p>"Sam...I've said it before and I'll say it again. You've got a keen mind to discern possibilities...How did you guess it was Ted?"</p>

<p>Samantha sighed and said, "Easy. What else could happen? Our lunch is gone, we've got a hot story that needs wrapping, and a stowaway cat... <em>Of course </em>Ted will want for us to start first...That way we have no time to prepare."</p>

<p>"Samantha, do you want me to call him and explain..." Dave began.</p>

<p>"Nope" Samantha interrupted. "I do well under pressure. My best stories are spontaneous. Let's go tiger!"</p>

<p>"Yeah! Where to?" Geronimo jumped up.</p>

<p>"Not you kitty...I meant my cameraman" Samantha explained.</p>

<p>"Have I ever told you that your green eyes sparkle when you are eager to do a story?" Dave smiled at the reporter.</p>

<p>"Yes. Often. Especially when we make love." Samantha winked at him.</p>

<p>Geronimo purred loudly. Samantha looked at the cat and said, "Geronimo. You must be quiet and stay here. We don't want you getting lost. After this story, we'll be dropping you off at home. Now, promise me you will stay here."</p>

<p>"I purrr-omise" said the cat. He squinted his blue eyes and stuck his tail up straight.</p>

<p>Samantha stared at the cat for a minute, a little uncertain as to whether he was planning more mischief, but he just sat there looking innocent. "Ok. Dave let's set up over there...I want to get some interviews."</p>

<p>Samantha grabbed a microphone and they walked quickly to a spot not far from the news van.</p>

<p>By now, the fire was under control and Samantha interviewed the fire chief.</p>

<p>Immersed in the questioning and filming, both reporter and cameraman forgot about the cat.</p><hr>

<p>"This is Samantha West...reporting live at the scene." Samantha ended her report.</p>

<p>As the monitor image shifted to the network broadcast’s next story, Dave smiled and said, "That's a wrap; now maybe we can go get something to eat."</p>

<p>As the two were gathering their equipment, a colleague from a newspaper came running over. "Hey guys! I just thought I'd give you fair warning about the picture that'll appear in the morning edition," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Daniel?" Samantha asked.</p>

<p>"The cat, of course. It's a cute touch...a cat with the news van. Is he some kind of mascot or good luck charm?" Daniel asked.</p>

<p>Dave and Samantha looked at each other, then looked at their station’s van.</p>

<p>It was a white commercial van adorned on its side with the recognizable red insignia of their television station – WCAT <big>⑧</big>. Underneath the call letters was a slim black parallelogram within which the word <em>NEWS</em> was spelled out in a glowing light-blue design. A microwave antenna was anchored on the roof of the vehicle; it was a tall, columnar fixture that reached to a large height, though it could shrink down to an unobtrusive size when not broadcasting.</p>

<p>There was one more thing atop the roof: a cat. It was a lynx-point Siamese cat which was happily poking the transmitter antenna. It was Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Geronimo!" the two television journalists shouted.</p>

<p>"Well, gotta go!" Daniel excused as he hurried away.</p>

<p>Geronimo, sensing another scolding, flattened his ears and hid inside the car. The reporter and her cameraman got into the van and drove away in silence. On the way to the television station they stopped in front of their home where their other two cats - Tifarah and Butch, Geronimo's parents - were basking in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Tifarah was a purebred Siamese with brilliant blue eyes and Butch was a brown-tabby-and-white tomcat.</p>

<p>Their son, Geronimo, had Siamese points and blue eyes like his mother yet stripes on his tail, legs and face like his father. His tail was kinked like the cats of ancient Siam, and the upward tilt of it was considered a rarity. He was an exquisite looking cat.</p>

<p>Samantha placed the young tomcat on the ground and looking into the eyes of two very perplexed cats, said "Ask your son to explain what he's been up to today. We'll discuss it after I get back from work. Tif, what do you want for dinner tonight? Sardines or Tuna?"</p>

<p>"It's all good, thanks." replied the cat and turned attention to her son, "What have you done, now?"</p>

<p>Before Geronimo could say anything, the news van sped off. Geronimo answered, "I'm not sure what the problem was...either the fact that I ate their ham sandwiches or maybe that guy from the newspaper taking my picture. You know, he said that I photograph well..."</p>

<p>"Wait..." Butch, his father interrupted. "What newspaper guy; what picture?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know him," Geronimo replied, "Daniel Thompson, the guy from <em>The Gazette</em>."</p>

<p>Tifarah opened her eyes wide and said, "Tangerine's human? He took your picture...for the newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Why would he take your picture, son?" Butch said through slitty eyes.</p>

<p>"I was sitting on top of the news van while Samantha was giving her report. You know there's a great view from up there." Geronimo purred.</p>

<p>The two older cats glanced at each other and then at their young son.</p>

<p>Butch was the first to speak. "As far as cat mischief goes...it's pretty good."</p>

<p>Tifarah added, "The problem is that our humans were working, and you're not supposed to be there at the time. In the future, don't climb onto the roof of the news van while they're reporting."</p>

<p>That evening, after Samantha and Dave arrived home, they explained to Geronimo that he should not be wandering very far.</p>

<p>"You might get lost," Samantha admonished.</p>

<p>"I won't," answered the cat, "I have a good sense of direction."</p><hr>

<p>The next morning, the newspaper was delivered as usual. On the front page was the story of the fire and on the second page was the picture of the news van with the cat sitting atop it. At the news office, Ted, the editor of WCAT News, was very surprised. "West, Candid, could you step into my office, please."</p>

<p>"Here it comes," Dave sighed.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," whispered Samantha.</p>

<p>Ted was sitting at his desk when the pair walked into the office. He was a tall, middle-aged man of average build, with brown hair and eyes and a trimmed mustache. He served as both assignment and managing editor in the newsroom, coordinating not only the news stories and personnel who covered them but also representing the news staff whenever the network's CEO chanced to call a meeting of the television station departments. Despite the small chain of command and the corresponding size of the town of Faunaville, where they were based, their station was the headquarters of the WCAT network and staunchly free of any outside influence on their reporting - a testament to Ted's excellent management of the newsroom.</p>

<p>"I always hoped I would be the first to know whenever our station got a mascot. When will I meet this lucky cat?" he said half-jokingly.</p>

<p>"Ted, I'm so sorry. We were really into our story and we didn't notice Geronimo had climbed on top of the van," Samantha explained.</p>

<p>"He even ate our lunch," Dave added.</p>

<p>"What was he doing in the news truck, to begin with?" Ted asked.</p>

<p>"Apparently, he snuck in. It won't happen again; I've spoken to him about it," Samantha replied.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no harm done. The station has actually gotten calls from the public saying the whole thing was a sweet idea. Let's call it an interesting situation, and let it go," Ted said. "I have a new assignment for you two."</p>

<p>Both Samantha and Dave seemed to brighten up. "Great! What's the story?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"Wildlife conference," their editor quickly explained. "The wire service just sent us a report from the mainland, saying it's going to be taking place the day after tomorrow in Vaharis. It's being organized by the governor of Nortenya to announce the recovery of certain threatened animal species. I'd like for both of you to travel to the mainland to cover this."</p>

<p>"We'll be there," Samantha quickly replied.</p>

<p>"Great. In that case, the two of you will be boarding a charter flight tomorrow, heading for the mainland. Unless something else comes up, that will be the week's top story. There’s talk the governor might soon be running for parliament; a lot of high-ranking politicos see him as a good candidate for prime minister."</p>

<p>Just then, the phone rang; as Ted lifted the receiver, he glanced at the pair. "Ok. You have your mission. Pick up the tickets at the airport before departure. Good luck."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave walked out of the office as Ted resumed the phone conversation. "We'd better hurry home and pack," said Samantha.</p>

<p>While Dave took the steering wheel, Samantha dialed her sister Leandra on her cell phone. Leandra and Laurence, her husband, were two local veterinarians. Samantha and her sister were close and would often talk; sometimes she even dropped by their practice to say hello.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lee...it's Sam."</p>

<p>"Hi Samantha! What's happening?" said the voice cheerily on the other end.</p>

<p>"Just to say hi...and to ask you to cat-sit."</p>

<p>"Let me guess. You've got an assignment off the island," Leandra deduced matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"You know me so well," chuckled Samantha.</p>

<p>"No problem with the kitty sitting, Sam. When will you bring the gang over?"</p>

<p>"Tonight. Later, ok?"</p>

<p>"Wow, so soon?"</p>

<p>"Yep. I'm leaving tomorrow. Sorry about the short notice, I just found out today, myself."</p>

<p>"That's ok, but bring over some cat food, because if I remember correctly, Geronimo can be picky about eating, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Samantha, "See you later."</p>

<p>When they arrived home, Tifarah, Butch and Geronimo were all sitting around their dishes staring at them.</p>

<p>A collective hiss rose up when Samantha and Dave noticed, and Tifarah said, "Samantha, I know you lead a busy schedule, but next time please just leave the food bowls full when you know you'll be back late."</p>

<p>"Sorry Tif, I didn't know I would be held up. As it turns out, I'm going on a business trip and all you guys will have to stay with Leandra and Laurence for a few days." As she said this, she poured some dry cat food into their dishes and while the cats attacked the food, she turned to face Dave. "Dave...what do you want to do about dinner?"</p>

<p>"Let's just order a pizza," he answered.</p>

<p>"So where's this trip taking you guys?" It was Geronimo, who had lifted his head up from the food dish and was staring at them with an oddly eager look in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Vaharis," Samantha replied.</p>

<p>Geronimo instantly leaped to his paws, eyes shining. "<em>The mainland</em>! Me-ow, now <em>that</em> sounds cool! Can I come with you? <em>Purrr</em>lease?"</p>

<p>"Geronimo..." Samantha started.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted to see the mainland," Geronimo continued obliviously. "Big skyscrapers, tons of people, hot-dog vendors..."</p>

<p>"No." said Samantha.</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"No. That's final. Geronimo, we can't bring you along!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" The lynx-point feline lashed his striped gray tail. Before either Samantha or Dave could respond, he meowed: "Leandra and Laurence bring <em>their</em> cats to work, sometimes."</p>

<p>"They're vets, we're journalists," Dave said.</p>

<p>"That's no excuse."</p>

<p>"Yes it is," Samantha replied. "How can we be out chasing a story if we have to worry about what you're up to?"</p>

<p>Geronimo flattened his ears, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Samantha glanced at Dave. "I'm going to call the pizzeria."</p>

<p>When the two had left the room, Geronimo turned to see Tifarah and Butch staring at him, stunned.</p>

<p>"Why on earth would you want to go to the mainland?" Tifarah hissed.</p>

<p>Geronimo flexed his claws in frustration. "I want to travel! Everyone else has adventures - why can't I?"</p>

<p>"You'll have plenty of time to prowl around when you get older; at any rate, we shouldn't leave the island," Butch meowed. "I've heard tales about the mainland...Many of the humans over there don't respect critters like they do here."</p>

<p>"Listen to your father." mewed Tifarah. "Here in Faunaville...on all of Tropical Island...people are nice. Off the island, not everyone is."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I want to feel the energy of the big city, the excitement of discovery, the thrill of danger..."</p>

<p>"Geronimo..."</p>

<p>"Like our humans! They're always going places and having adventures...one day they're in town at the hustle and bustle of a cat show, the next - wham! They're half-way across the globe in some war-torn country trying to shoot a live report in the midst of peril!"</p>

<p>As if accentuating his words, he took a gigantic leap in the air and attacked a cat toy nearby. The bell inside the tiny green ball jingled incoherently as he let out a fierce growl.</p>

<p>The older cats glanced at one another, eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>As Geronimo tussled with the toy, Butch spoke to Tifarah. "Don't worry. It's a phase tomcats go through. Once he matures a bit more, he'll realize that it’s not all fun and games out there."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right," answered Tifarah.</p><h3>Chapter 2 - Stowaway</h3>

<p>A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance, heralding the morning.</p>

<p>Tifarah, Butch and Geronimo had been dropped off at Leandra's the night before; and were just leaving the house to go on their morning prowls.</p>

<p>Leandra and Laurence had already left for work and their cats, as well as the visiting felines, were eager to go outdoors. All the cats were dispersing through the cat door and although Tifarah and Butch had taken a right turn, Geronimo took a left. Butch called out to him. "Ger...where are you off to?"</p>

<p>"Not far" answered Geronimo, "I thought I'd prowl around our home base. We'll only be at Leandra's for a couple of weeks and I want to keep up the prowl schedule."</p>

<p>Butch looked at his son proudly. Tifarah said "Be careful. Traffic is busy this time of the morning."</p>

<p>Geronimo bounded off and without looking back answered, "Don't worry."</p>

<p>Tifarah watched as he ran off and thought to herself, <em>I always worry.</em></p><hr>

<p>About ten minutes later, Geronimo had arrived at his home. He noticed that the window was open where the bedroom was located. "Well...it looks like the humans haven't left on their trip yet. I'll go have a look." Having said that, he took a flying leap, landed right on the window sill and peeked in.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave were hurrying around trying to get some last-minute packing done, so they didn't notice as the cat snuck into the bedroom and hid under the bed.</p>

<p>"Dave...Have you packed extra camera film? You know sometimes it's hard to find the right kind for our cameras." Samantha's voice was coming from the closet. She was busy retrieving something and emerged with a triumphant look on her face and holding a clothes-hanger on which a peacoat was hung. "Finally!" she exclaimed. "I never get a chance to wear this coat here on the island because it's for colder weather."</p>

<p>Dave walked into the room holding a couple of ties. "I already packed the camera film...I think we've got everything we need."</p>

<p>Dave dropped the ties in his knapsack, zipped it shut and turned to Samantha, "Have I told you today how much I love you?"</p>

<p>Samantha smiled and wrapped her arms around him in a big hug. "Say the words... I never tire of hearing them."</p>

<p>"I love you" answered Dave.</p>

<p>Samantha kissed him and whispered in his ear, "I love you too."</p>

<p>During this time, Geronimo had been analyzing the situation from beneath the bed. He thought to himself, <em>Why not get into one of the bags and go on a real adventure? After all, my Dad has told me many escapades he had when he was a feral cat...He was just a little older than I am...I'll probably be back in time for dinner...</em></p>

<p>While the humans were still distracted with each other, Geronimo jumped onto the bed and into the duffel bag that was wide open next to the knapsack. It was full of camera equipment and he squeezed into a corner of it. When Dave and Samantha parted from each other she said, "Dave, you forgot your pajamas... here, throw them in the duffel bag. There's still room in there." She handed them over and he answered, "I don't think I'll be needing them much..."</p>

<p>"Dave...we'll be working all day long."</p>

<p>"But our nights will be free..." he winked at her.</p>

<p>Samantha winked back and laughed. "While you're at it, throw in these scarves too, my bags are full already."</p>

<p>Dave took the pajamas and scarves, rolled them into a ball and pitched them into the duffel bag.</p>

<p>The clothing landed right over Geronimo. The cat curled up for a nap and Dave zipped up the bag completely clueless to his little passenger.</p>

<p>A taxicab was waiting for them in front of the house. "Where to?" the driver asked as they stepped out onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Tropical Island International Airport," Samantha replied while Dave locked the front gate. She opened the door to the back seat of the taxi as Dave appeared beside her. He placed the duffel bag and knapsack inside.</p>

<p>Geronimo was flattened as Samantha put her legs up on the duffel bag. He growled.</p>

<p>"What was that?" she asked.</p>

<p>Dave shrugged.</p>

<p>The drive to the airport was swift, and once there, boarding was equally quick. A Pomeranian in a pet carrier started yapping ferociously as Samantha and Dave passed by.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I don't know what got into her," the dog's owner apologized.</p>

<p>"That's all right," Samantha replied.</p>

<p>A hiss came from the duffel bag as they left the canine behind, but neither the reporter nor her cameraman paid much attention as they hurried from check-in into Gate 5E.</p>

<p>After showing their press passes and tickets to the stewardess at this point, they went out onto the airfield and walked up the towering steps leading from the ground to the doorway of the waiting charter flight. The duffel bag was placed on the carry-on shelf above their seats and the plane began coursing along the runway. When at last it was airborne, the pair settled in for the long trip to Vaharis.</p><hr>

<p>The nation of Sarrilla was a world power, of which Tropical Island was a commonwealth. Vaharis, the capital of the Nortenya region, was Sarrilla's largest northern city and was located on the outer edges of the Arctic Circle; it could only be reached by train. The Nortenya airport, hence, doubled as a train station and had become the region's main transportation center.</p>

<p>When the reporters' airplane landed in Nortenya, they waited for about 10 minutes before the train pulled into the station and were again en route to Vaharis. The train ride was quiet and scenic, and an hour later they disembarked.</p>

<p>Before stepping outside, the TV news crew changed into clothes suitable for the frozen climate. Samantha retrieved the tawny peacoat that she had packed - it was wool, with an inside lining of rabbit fur that made it the warmest coat she had.</p>

<p>"I can't wait until we can cover that story tomorrow." Samantha said enthusiastically, "Hopefully we can get the governor to say a couple of good sound bites..."</p>

<p>"...and we’ll get a few good camera shots, too," Dave responded with a grin. "I'm hungry - want to go eat somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Once we're settled at the lodge, I'll be able to relax and think about eating. I want some time to prepare for tomorrow's event." Samantha said, settling a matching fedora hat on her head.</p>

<p>"We should call our editor then," Dave considered.</p>

<p>They approached a public phone and Samantha dialed the number. When she got Ted on the other line, he gave further instructions:</p>

<p>"You ought to rest for the remainder of the day - tomorrow you'll head over to the Convention Center, where they'll be holding the conference. I've informed the editor of WCAT's Vaharis Bureau that you guys will be hanging out with them and working out of their office for a while. His name is Devon Gao, we've known each other since college. He told me he would send a car to pick you guys up when you arrived at the train station, so keep your eyes open for a WCAT news van."</p>

<p>"Sounds good" said Samantha.</p>

<p>"Call me periodically and keep me up to date."</p>

<p>"Ok, Ted, will do."</p>

<p>As she finished the telephone call, she heard a car horn at the curb and turned to look. Through the phone booth's glass partitions she noticed one of their network's large white satellite vans with the WCAT logo across its side.</p>

<p>"Samantha, Dave! Nice to see the two of you again!" It was the driver, a man about Dave's age but of a slimmer build, with brown hair and hazel eyes.</p>

<p>"Todd Truitt," Samantha greeted the driver as she joined Dave at the sidewalk edge. "Nice to see you too. How's your wife?"</p>

<p>"She's fine; she loved the trip to Tropical Island and she made me promise that the next time I have to do a report from there, I bring her along" Todd said, opening the door. "By the way, Gao told me to pick you two up and take you to the TV station. He said you can use the news van while you're in Vaharis, since that way you won't have to rent a car."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Ted told us" Samantha responded as she and Dave got into the car.</p>

<p>The WCAT affiliate in Vaharis was only two blocks away from the train station, and the newsroom was located on the fifth floor. The facade of the building was different than the Faunaville station. Pressed against the adjoining skyscrapers with only alleyways to divide them, it stood in contrast with the wide, mossy grass fields that surrounded the headquarters. On Tropical Island, the station's news helicopter would land in the back field, the broadcast transmitter was beside the building, and the vast satellite antennas were placed overlooking the clear lake in front of the building and its parking lot. Here, the heliport was atop the building, along with the antennas and transmitter, and the parking space for the cars was underground, accessible by a slope leading from the street into the basement.</p>

<p>The elevator brought them up onto the fifth floor. For any difference the outside might have had, they found the building inside to be the image of the headquarters' offices. Crossing a small, carpeted hallway, they entered a room without a door, with large windows on either side of the entryway - it was labeled 'Newsroom' on the right. It was the picturesque newsroom; as bright and active as the one in Faunaville, with the tapping of keyboards mingling with the rings of telephones, and an atmosphere imbued with unceasing, dedicated energy. Lining the wall was a map of the world and a line of clocks, each set to a different time zone; throughout the office were televisions to monitor both WCAT's and competitors' channels, and to the far end of the newsroom was the studio, open for easy access so that one could simply dash to it to broadcast a breaking news bulletin. Opposite this was the editor's office; the door was marked: Devon Gao.</p>

<p>Devon Gao was about Ted's age, of Asian descent with black hair and brown eyes. He glanced up from his desk as the reporters walked into the newsroom and gestured to them to come over.</p>

<p>As the pair walked into his office, Gao got up and smiling, reached out to shake their hands. "Welcome to our newsroom. Ted speaks highly of you two. Whatever you need, my door is open."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. Gao" said Samantha.</p>

<p>After spending an hour at the newsroom, Samantha and Dave were given keys to a news van and told they could use it throughout their stay in town. They said goodbye and drove to the lodge where they would be living while doing their report.</p><hr>

<p>Nestled in Hammond Forest, the lodge was the seeming antithesis of Vaharis' majestic skyscrapers; yet the city and the wooded area were separated only by aptly-named Whirlpool River.</p>

<p>After checking in, they were given directions that led to a small cabin surrounded by pine woodland. To the left was a white glow that was a frozen lake; beyond that were more pines, but the land seemed to drop off at some point where one could just make out, far behind the trees, a white expanse of barren snow. The reporters had been given the choice of staying at the high-rise hotel in the center of the city, but had opted to stay in the forest area so that they could have a better opportunity of photographing wildlife.</p>

<p>Samantha was delighted with the cottage. "Look how cute!" she said, "It looks like something out of a..."</p>

<p>Dave, dragging the duffel bag out of the back of the news van, squinted. "Well, it's bigger than the hut we got on the African savannah..."</p>

<p>"Very cozy" Samantha added.</p>

<p>"I bet we'll get lots of great pictures out here" Dave said.</p>

<p>The cabin inside was little, but comfortable. The floor and walls were all of a light-tan wood, and the rest of the cabin was decorated in light-green. Upon entering, one was greeted by a large living room area with a sofa, two armchairs and a coffee table. A flight of steps was to the left of the front door. The steps were made of small logs cut sideways and polished to smooth away all the sharp sides. Beyond the living room, was a kitchenette complete with stove, refrigerator, counter and cabinets. A circular wood table with four chairs was in the center and a telephone hung on the wall near it. The second floor was where the bedroom was. It too, was dressed in light-green, with a matching rug laid out on the floor; a night table with a telephone extension was beside the bed. A window was on one side of the bed and a chest of drawers was on the other. The bathroom was also up here. The cabin had modern heating and cooling throughout.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> cozy," Dave said, placing the duffel bag on the bed.</p>

<p>"The view outside is great, too," said Samantha, putting her bags next to the duffel bag.</p>

<p>Dave was glancing out the window. "Wouldn't it be great to get a few shots of the forest scenery, right now?"</p>

<p>Samantha appeared interested. "That's not a bad idea!"</p>

<p>Dave reached over and unzipped the duffel bag, retrieving his camera and her microphone without even so much as a second glance inside. "You know," Samantha was saying as Dave walked over and handed her the microphone, "this is rather romantic. We're out in the forest...we have the place all to ourselves..."</p>

<p>"Just the two of us," Dave whispered as he put his arms around her.</p>

<p>"Hi guys!" Geronimo broke in, peeking out of the duffel bag.</p>

<p>There was shocked silence for a moment...then...</p>

<p>"<em>Geronimo</em>!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," was the only thing Samantha could say.</p>

<p>Geronimo leaped to the window. "Are we in Vaharis?" His eyes were shining, his ears were pricked, his tail held straight up; the picture of feline excitement.</p>

<p>"Wait a second..." Dave still looked bewildered. "You traveled all the way from the Caribbean to the Arctic...in our <em>camera equipment</em>?"</p>

<p>Geronimo turned back to look at his stunned humans. "Nice! Is that halfway around the world?"</p>

<p>"Why did you do this, Geronimo?" Samantha asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"To travel! See the world!" Geronimo caterwauled happily.</p>

<p>There was another pause as the TV news crew and the cat merely stared at each other; at last, Geronimo broke the silence.</p>

<p>"So...aren't you glad to see me?"</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave glanced at one another but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on," Geronimo persisted. "I'm like your feline sidekick!"</p>

<p>Samantha seemed at a loss for words, and Dave tried to explain..."Geronimo...let me put it this way. In filming a TV news story you only need two things. Audio..." - he motioned towards Samantha - "and Video" - he motioned towards himself.</p>

<p>"Right," Geronimo interrupted. "And a kitty..."</p>

<p>"No...wait. Let me start over..."</p>

<p>Samantha broke in at this point. "Geronimo...we love you, but you aren't supposed to be here."</p>

<p>The cat's ears flattened. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"We told you not to come." Samantha scolded. "Your being here is a hassle for us. How can we focus on our work while worrying about you?"</p>

<p>"There's no need to worry about me," Geronimo insisted.</p>

<p>Samantha sighed. "All right. You got to travel. But now you're going back to Tropical Island."</p>

<p>"Damn. Shit!" the cat hissed.</p>

<p>"We're heading out now; we'll get you some cat food and a litter box for the day or so you'll be here." Samantha said. "After that, you're getting on the next plane back to the island." Her gaze softened when she saw his whiskers droop. "Geronimo, I'm sorry, but we're here on an assignment, not a vacation. This isn't Faunaville, where pets are welcome everywhere."</p>

<p>The cat stared into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Listen, cat...I know what you're trying to do. The 'poor kitty' look is not going to work."</p>

<p>The cat continued to stare, his eyes widening.</p>

<p>Samantha stared back. The cat's whiskers twitched.</p>

<p>Dave started counting. "One, two, three..."</p>

<p>"All right, you win" Samantha said. "You can stay, but only if you don't prowl around very far outside. We don't know this area."</p>

<p>She turned around and found a smiling Dave. "He's perfecting his 'kitty look'. It only took him three seconds to talk you into his idea" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh well" she answered. "We won't be in this town very long, anyway."</p>

<p>The couple put their things away and turned to leave.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, we'll be back soon with your supper" said Samantha as she and Dave walked out the door. As soon as they got in the car, she said, "I'm rather tired from the trip. When we get back, I just want to shower and go to bed."</p>

<p>"I agree" answered Dave, "We can call your sister tomorrow and tell her Geronimo is with us."</p>

<p>Inside the cabin, the cat had gone downstairs and leapt up to the window, settling down to scan the scene. He tucked his paws under himself and crouched into a furry lump. Outside, everything was brown except for the evergreen trees and some patches of snow, here and there. Geronimo was falling asleep, when movement outside caught his eye. His ears picked up a faint sound and he fixed his gaze at some holly bushes a few yards away. His cat senses told him there was something out there.</p>

<p>As he stared at the bushes, out emerged two white furred creatures.</p><h3>Chapter 3 - The Escape</h3>

<p>Geronimo had never seen anything quite like these animals - they were about his size, yet looked like fluffy white canines of some sort. They had small paws, big amber eyes, and beautiful bushy tails. One was male, the other female, that much Geronimo could ascertain; but the young tomcat was perplexed as to their species. <em>They look like foxes,</em> he thought, <em>but their fur is white!</em></p>

<p>The two critters were padding along happily - clearly heading somewhere - when the male noticed Geronimo in the window. He stopped suddenly, ears pricked. Geronimo sat up curiously.</p>

<p>Just then, the male critter leapt up to the window, sniffing at the glass. He said something, but Geronimo couldn't hear him.</p>

<p>Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>The critter paced on the windowsill outside with his head down and tail twitching. Again he yapped something at Geronimo.</p>

<p>"I can't hear you," said Geronimo, poking at the glass with a paw.</p>

<p>The critters outside couldn't hear the cat either, and after a few tries of communicating to no avail, the female said something to her mate, who hopped down from the windowsill. The two, then scampered off into the woods. Geronimo sighed in disappointment as he watched them leave.</p><hr>

<p>"Hey, glad you're back!" Geronimo purred when his humans returned later that evening. "I saw something really interesting outside..."</p>

<p>Samantha scooped the cat up in her arms without paying much attention. "We got you some food - and a litter box. You didn't do anything while we were out of the house, did you?"</p>

<p>"No...where's the food?" Geronimo licked his lips.</p>

<p>Samantha carried the cat up to the second floor, where Dave had set up the litter box in an inconspicuous corner of the bathroom. She plopped the cat down in the sand and ran his paws through the gravel. "<em>This</em> is where you go."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," Geronimo meowed, hopping out. "Listen, I saw two critters outside I've never seen before."</p>

<p>"Lots of animals are distinctly northern, just like lots of others are distinctly tropical" Dave reminded him.</p>

<p>"They looked like fluffy white puffs with big eyes." Geronimo purred. "They came right up to the window, and..."</p>

<p>"Oh, it could have been anything," interrupted Samantha. "Many critters here have white fur coats because it helps them camouflage in the snow. Anyway, I got you some sardines."</p>

<p>"Yay, sardines!" yowled Geronimo, running ahead of Samantha to the kitchenette downstairs, and thus ending the conversation on white furred critters.</p><hr>

<p>The next day was foggy with the conference taking place that evening at six. Until then, Samantha and Dave had the day to themselves.</p>

<p>They were having breakfast when the telephone rang.</p>

<p>Samantha answered, "Hello?"</p>

<p>"Hi, sis." It was Leandra.</p>

<p>"Lee, I was just going to call you. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Well..." said Leandra, her voice tense, "I hate to worry you for no reason, but Geronimo is lost."</p>

<p>"I know...he's with us."</p>

<p>"...<em>What</em>? How'd that happen?"</p>

<p>"He hid in our luggage." Samantha explained, squinting at Geronimo as he hopped onto her chair and tried to sniff the bacon on her plate. "We discovered him when we were already at the lodge."</p>

<p>"Are you going to ship him back?" said Leandra.</p>

<p>"Nah." answered Samantha, as she noticed Dave waving the cat away from the breakfast plate and feeding him a piece of bacon. "He might as well stay with us, we'll only be away a couple of days. Tell Tifarah for me, will you? I don't want her to worry" she added.</p>

<p>"Ok...keep in touch."</p>

<p>"Thanks Lee; bye."</p>

<p>As Leandra hung up the telephone, she turned to see four pairs of cat eyes staring at her. Laurence and Leandra's own pets - Lilith the black cat and Tom the orange tabby - were sitting atop the kitchen table with a curious look in their eyes. Butch was curled up on a chair, relaxed, while an extremely worried Tifarah was below the table.</p>

<p>"Tifarah," said Leandra somewhat hesitantly, "I have good news and bad news..." When the Siamese flicked an ear, she went on, "The good news is, we know where Geronimo is."</p>

<p>Tifarah leapt to her paws. "Thank God! Where is he?!"</p>

<p>"The bad news is...he's on the mainland." Leandra finished.</p>

<p>Tifarah switched from relief to dismay. "<em>What</em>?! What on earth is he doing over there?!"</p>

<p>"That's my boy," Butch meowed proudly. "Out there spreading his genes."</p>

<p>"My kitten!" Tifarah wailed.</p>

<p>"He's not a little kitten anymore, Tif," said Butch. "He's growing."</p>

<p>"So how did he get over there?" inquired a very interested Tom.</p>

<p>"It seems he was a luggage stowaway," Leandra explained.</p>

<p>"That is a brilliant idea," meowed Lilith. "How come we never thought of something like that, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Because we never considered leaving this town, Lil" answered her mate.</p>

<p>"Yeah. That's true. Why would we?" Lilith replied thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Tifarah yowled. "I sure hope he doesn't wander very far from the den!"</p>

<p>A hiss arose from Butch's corner. "What's the point of it all, then?" he said. "If you're gonna do something, do it right. He's supposed to venture out and prowl new turf, every now and then."</p>

<p>"Butch" said Leandra, "Keep in mind that Geronimo is in an unknown area."</p>

<p>At this point, Laurence walked into the room, followed by Lilith and Tom's three kittens - a female and two males.</p>

<p>Laurence said, "What's this I hear about Geronimo? A stowaway?"</p>

<p>"Yep," replied Leandra. "He hid in my sister's luggage."</p>

<p>"When can we do that?" squeaked the kittens.</p>

<p>"Never," Lilith meowed. "You stay put with whatever human feeds and cares for you. That's how you stay safe."</p>

<p>Tom spoke up and said, "Sometimes a tomcat has to venture far and explore new territory..."</p>

<p>Lilith hissed at him and he added hurriedly, "...However, I think stowing away is a bit much."</p>

<p>The three kittens looked from parent to parent and then at each other. "I guess that means we'll have to wait 'till we're a bit older to find out," relented one of the boy kittens.</p><hr>

<p>Geronimo was feeling a little frustrated. Samantha and Dave had spent most of the day indoors, planning for the story they were going to cover that evening and to let the cat out to prowl was out of the question for them.</p>

<p>"Ger looks really pissed." Dave said. "He's sitting in the window downstairs with flat ears."</p>

<p>"I know he must feel annoyed," Samantha replied, looking in the bathroom mirror and putting on pearl earrings. "We always let him outside in Faunaville, but we're in the middle of a forest in an unfamiliar place. He's not even supposed to be here." Satisfied with the way she looked, Samantha grabbed her gloves and walked quickly to the stairs. "Ready, honey?"</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am," her cameraman smiled.</p>

<p>They hurried downstairs where Samantha and Dave found their microphone and camera; Geronimo became alert and leapt off the windowsill. "Oh, yeah! We're off on a mission! Going to pester people at that convention-thingy!"</p>

<p>"Hold it, Ger...what do you mean <em>we</em>?" Samantha squinted at him. "<em>Dave and I</em> are going to cover this story. <em>You</em> will remain here."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be a problem for you." Geronimo entwined himself around her legs, purring. "I'd just sit up high somewhere being real quiet and ambush the waiter when he comes by with seafood."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what we don't want," Samantha informed him dryly.</p>

<p>"It would be great news! That's what you're after, right? CAT ATTACK. Think about the possibilities!"</p>

<p>"Ok, first off, we don't <em>create</em> news to report it, we just report what's already happening." Dave explained. "Secondly, we don't want a repeat of your escapade that day we were covering the apartment fire. Our editor won't be too happy with that."</p>

<p>"Shit, man - come on!" Geronimo was now fluffed up. "You don't expect to keep me cooped up in this tiny cabin forever!"</p>

<p>"As long as you're here, yes." Samantha said.</p>

<p>Geronimo bared his fangs in a hiss.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave both appeared amused. "Well," said Samantha, "We'll be back in a couple of hours. We're dropping by the news office first, then we'll head to the conference. Try to stay out of trouble."</p>

<p>"I promise nothing," Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>Without a word in response, the two stepped outside, shutting the door behind them. Annoyed, the cat's innate curiosity finally motivated him to leap back atop the windowsill. From his post there, he watched his humans get into the car, then back out onto the road and drive off.</p>

<p>Frustration was swept away with longing. He wanted to go with them and see what was happening in the city. The tomcat stood up on his hind legs to get a better look outside, wistfully pressing his forepaws on the glass...</p>

<p>Just then, the window jerked open.</p>

<p>Geronimo stared down in surprise. The window apparently had been left unlatched by the previous tenants, and with Geronimo having leant against the window pane, it had opened in the most opportune manner. Turning to look outside again, the cat let out a sly purr; he pushed against the glass with all his strength - the window completely opened, and he toppled out with a meow.</p>

<p>Freezing arctic air instantly blasted him, and instinctually he fluffed up his fur. However, that did little to stop him as he raced off in the direction the car had gone, determined to catch up to his humans. He ran confidently until he reached a large thoroughfare, surrounded by forest and bordered on one side by a railroad line. Old, brittle snow was piled on each side of the street, and cars were zooming past.</p>

<p><em>Which way could they have gone?</em></p>

<p>Geronimo turned around, planning to head back to the cabin, but suddenly realized that he had no idea where that was, either. He had run without noticing the territory and now did not know how to get back.</p>

<p>Geronimo looked up into the milky-white sky. <em>Just great. My humans are lost, and the den was misplaced. Now what?</em></p>

<p>As if in silent answer, snow began to fall.</p><h3>Chapter 4 - Governor of the Nortenya region</h3>

<p>Vaharis was the capital of the Nortenya region. It was a vibrant metropolis as rich in culture as it was in status. This was the city of progress, of activity, and the people who traversed the sidewalks were rushed and alert, their quickness suggesting a matter of great importance beckoned them. The city itself held an energy of enticing power and the sense that something, somewhere was happening, amidst its infinitely towering buildings which created steel, concrete canyons filled with noisily complaining automobiles.</p>

<p>Samantha West and Dave Candid had arrived at the Convention Center, and were met at the entrance by security.</p>

<p>"Good evening sir, miss - may I see your passes, please?"</p>

<p>Both retrieved their press cards. "Right this way," said the guard, escorting them inside.</p>

<p>The room was wide and elegant. Lighting seemed to lend a form of twilight to the ambience; the carpeting was of a red color, and most of the decor - including the stage and round dining tables - were a shiny black, creating an exotic look. An overhead projector was on standby for the event, and a white cloth screen was hung for this use; thick red curtains fringed with gold tassels draped on either side of it. There were a large number of people in the conference hall, dressed in business attire, and the majority were seated at the tables, talking amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave were shown to the press area. There were tables assigned to each media entity that had declared their intention to attend. Once at the WCAT table, the two set up their camera and recording devices and sat down. Dinner was to be served first; and then the speakers would take the podium and speak in turn.</p>

<p>More people filtered into the room and soon every table, including the ones designated for the journalists, were filled.</p>

<p>The waiters embarked on the difficult task of delivering meals to the guests and making sure that everyone was satisfied. Before long, the tables were cleared of the dishes and tension filled the air with expectations.</p>

<p>A man in a grey suit rose from his seat and approached the podium on the stage. This was the mayor of Vaharis, who began his introductory speech. He spoke for half an hour, mostly about the wildlife and the significant roles they had played in the history of the region, as well as emphasizing the importance of conservation.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave listened as the Vaharis mayor finished his speech. While Dave focused the camera on him, Samantha's eyes drifted from the stage to scan the audience, and she began a mental selection of potential interviewees. Most of the people here were either political supporters, wildlife experts, or representatives of wildlife conservation groups. One person in particular stood out, wearing the uniform of a park ranger. <em>Him. He looks like a reliable source.</em></p>

<p>"<em>Hello</em>!" A mew broke into her thoughts. Glancing down, Samantha saw a beautiful longhaired cat staring up at her. It was black and white with a lavender collar studded with amethysts. "You like cats! I can tell."</p>

<p>"Hi kitty," the television reporter smiled, bending down to pet her. "Where's your human?"</p>

<p>Before the cat had a chance to respond, the mayor announced:</p>

<p>"...I'd like to welcome Victor Ulrich, Governor of the Nortenya region!"</p>

<p>Applause resonated through the auditorium, and when Samantha glanced up, the tuxedo cat quickly scampered off.</p>

<p>The governor was middle-aged, with pale blue eyes and auburn hair streaked with white. He had the confident stride of an experienced politician, a man whose charisma and connections had brought him into office. Stepping up onto the stage, he let the applause quiet before speaking.</p>

<p>"Thank you all for coming. I stand here tonight with not just an announcement, but a tale of courage. A tale of heartwarming success set in the most unexpected and harshest of places." The governor clicked a button on the remote control, and the overhead projector displayed an image of glaciers and frozen tundra. As he spoke, he periodically changed the picture. "The Arctic Circle, long regarded as a land both beautiful and vicious. Explorers told of its bountiful wildlife...but where we today see nature's beauty, they saw lucrative opportunity. The land was ravaged, its animals slaughtered. The effects of those careless acts nearly destroyed our northern wildlife. For some - such as the great auk - it was too late. For others - like the mighty polar bear, the symbol of the Arctic - the fight had begun. But among these creatures, one stands out as the picture of triumph, of victory against impossible odds..."</p>

<p>Ulrich clicked the button again, and the image changed to that of a fluffy white canine. "The arctic fox. Known by the scientific community as <em>Alopex Lagopus</em>, this small, endearing animal was the target of trappers who ruthlessly hunted it for its valuable winter fur. At last, with only 1,500 remaining in the wild, it was given protection as an endangered species."</p>

<p>He paused, letting his words settle on the hushed audience, then once again changed the picture on the screen to a line graph.</p>

<p>"Today, our wildlife is thriving!" he announced. "Thanks to the legislation which I enacted to protect them, the once-dwindling arctic fox now numbers more than 150,000 - and is once more abundant and flourishing on the tundra!"</p>

<p>During all this time, Samantha was listening to the speech, but she was also scanning the audience for their reactions. Her eyes caught sight of the ranger, who was shaking his head disapprovingly. <em>He seems a bit upset by what the governor is saying,</em> Samantha thought. She scribbled a reminder of it in her notepad.</p>

<p>Onstage, Governor Ulrich was finishing his speech. "With this wonderful accomplishment, I have begun proceedings to get the arctic fox delisted, to officially crown it a wildlife success story!"</p>

<p>The crowd burst into applause. Samantha glanced back at the ranger and noticed that he was not clapping. This intrigued Samantha, who instantly sensed a story. <em>That's it. I have to interview the guy.</em></p>

<p>"Sam, I recognize that gleam in your eyes." Dave's knowing voice broke into her thoughts. "What are you up to?"</p>

<p>"Dave...You see that wildlife ranger over there?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"Yeah. He doesn't seem too thrilled with the governor's speech."</p>

<p>"Exactly" she said. "Doesn't regional government typically discuss delisting of wildlife with the rangers? I mean...you would think that he would be in agreement with this announcement."</p>

<p>"You're right about that. It seems a little weird," answered Dave.</p>

<p>The speech was finished and the event decidedly over, so the governor was off the stage and surrounded by various members of the media, clamoring for their turn at an interview. Samantha, of course, headed instead towards the park ranger.</p>

<p>"Samantha..." Dave called out behind her. "Sam...I think we're headed in the wrong direction. The governor is to the right of us."</p>

<p>"Yep. I know it," she answered. "The ranger is the first person I want to interview. The governor will be around a while longer, what with all the other reporters trying to get a story. I want to know why anyone would be upset with the news."</p>

<p>The ranger was standing up to leave when they arrived at his table. He was a tall, black man, who seemed a bit surprised to see the TV news crew's quick appearance.</p>

<p>"Hi - I'm Samantha West from WCAT 8 News - my photographer, Dave Candid," the reporter introduced herself and her companion. "We'd like to interview you for our evening broadcast... What are your views on Governor Ulrich's announcement?"</p>

<p>The ranger sighed. "Well, it would be great...any improvement in arctic fox numbers would be spectacular... But I've noticed a population <em>decline</em>, not a rebound."</p>

<p>"A decline?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Fox tracks are becoming even rarer than before, there aren't many traces of the animals anywhere..."</p>

<p>"What do you think is the cause?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea. The fox's usual prey - lemmings - haven't been very abundant recently, and the fox population tends to rise and fall with the lemmings, but never this much. It can't be the lemmings. I thought that it might be a disease, but the few foxes I do see look healthy enough - though they're all skittish lately."</p>

<p>"Did the governor ever contact you before his announcement?"</p>

<p>"No... When I learned about it, I tried to contact his office, but each time my calls went unanswered. Frankly, I didn't think he would go so far as to try to delist the species," the ranger said.</p>

<p>"What's your name, sir?" asked Samantha, "...and may we quote you?"</p>

<p>"Jovan Conway," answered the ranger, "Yes, you may quote me; perhaps that will prompt Ulrich to call me and discuss the issue."</p>

<p>Samantha handed him a card. "Ranger Conway, if you have anything further you'd like to add, or if the governor ever calls you...please call us."</p>

<p>"Sure," he replied.</p>

<p>As Conway left, Samantha and Dave walked over to where Governor Ulrich was responding to questions. "...Certainly," they heard him saying, "but <em>I </em>championed the legislation which helped the wildlife return."</p>

<p>Samantha broke in, "Governor, we just spoke with one of the rangers who says that the arctic fox population is actually declining. Do you have anything you'd like to comment on that?"</p>

<p>Ulrich focused a steely, icy glare on the reporter. "No comment," he replied coldly.</p>

<p>If there was one person who couldn't be intimidated, it was Samantha. In his hostility she saw a secret and in that secret, she saw a story. Her green eyes gleamed like a cat who had cornered prey, and she persisted, "So you don't <em>deny</em> that..."</p>

<p>"Anything else you need to know," he interrupted brusquely, "you'll find in my speech...Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>At this point, Ulrich turned around and left, surrounded by body guards. The reporters dispersed, some of them comparing notes of the speech and interview.</p>

<p>Samantha was deep in thought as she watched the governor walk away.</p>

<p>"He seemed pissed off with that question."</p>

<p>Upon hearing her cameraman's remark, Samantha turned to look at him. "Yeah...I wonder why? I get the feeling that there's more to this man than meets the eye. He's hiding something; I can sense it."</p>

<p>"Well...I guess this is a wrap," Dave said as he turned to go.</p>

<p>"Know what?" said Samantha "I'd like to add the final words of the report with a shot on the outside of the building"</p>

<p>The reporter and her cameraman gathered their gear and headed out the door.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, within the building's back quarters; there was a VIP lounge where only members were allowed. The governor's wife, Mabel, was seated at a small round mahogany table having tea. On her lap was a beautiful, black and white longhaired cat with green eyes and an elegant lavender collar.</p>

<p>The lady was stroking the cat's fur and speaking to it.</p>

<p>"How's my darling Roxanne? Do you want more caviar?"</p>

<p>The cat purred in contentment and replied, "<em>Non. Je suis content</em>...happy. <em>Merci</em>, Madame."</p>

<p>Mabel Ulrich was a quiet woman of about 35. She had dark brown hair which she typically wore in a bun; and eyes that sparkled when she laughed.</p>

<p>Laughter for Mabel was a rarity, because her marriage to the governor was not a very happy one. Lately, he had not been very attentive to her and she felt unwanted. Disappointment often showed on her face. The cat sensed this and looked up into her grey blue eyes.</p>

<p>The cat spoke. "Madame, what is it? Are you well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>cherie</em>...I'm fine." she answered.</p>

<p>Mabel had no children, although she had tried to coax her husband into parenthood, unsuccessfully. At that moment, Governor Ulrich stepped into the room and went directly to her table.</p>

<p>"Hello, darling" she said.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mabel, dear" Ulrich bent down and kissed her cheek, avoiding her lips.</p>

<p>The lady looked down at the cat, to hide her tears.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>The wind outside was sharply cold and it was snowing; the grey skies were a reflection of Mabel's despondent feelings. The governor and his wife stepped outside to a waiting limousine, where the chauffeur opened the door for them. Just then, Ulrich noticed a man approaching.</p>

<p>"Get in," Ulrich ordered Mabel.</p>

<p>Without a word she obeyed, though Roxanne the cat hissed as he shut the door.</p>

<p>The man halted only a small distance from them. The body guards instantly jumped to send him on his way, but Ulrich coolly gestured for them to stay back.</p>

<p>"Interesting speech, governor."</p>

<p>"You know as well as I, that we can't be seen together in public." Ulrich's voice was taut. "We'll keep in touch."</p>

<p>Across the street, fate had given the camera a direct, unplanned view of the limousine; the harsh shine of klieg lights glittered in the nighttime darkness and outlined in the glow, was the slender figure of the television reporter...</p>

<p>"...Not everyone is happy with the governor's announcement. Park ranger Jovan Conway told us he's seen a decline in the arctic fox population. Conway says the governor's office never contacted rangers before the announcement and that calls he made have gone unanswered. When we asked Ulrich, he declined to comment. Reporting from Vaharis, Nortenya, I'm Samantha West for WCAT 8 News."</p>

<p>As Samantha wrapped up her report, Dave glanced over and saw the Governor's black limousine drive off. "Looks like Ulrich came out in the background talking with someone."</p>

<p>"Did you see who it was?" asked an interested Samantha.</p>

<p>"No, but I suppose it was one of his bodyguards," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Well, it's getting late," she said. "We'd better get back to the cabin before Geronimo goes shredding something, but first we need to drop by the newsroom. The wind's starting to pick up and it's snowing a lot more now."</p>

<p>The pair packed up all the gear into the news van. They drove to WCAT's Vaharis bureau, and as they walked into the newsroom, Dave said, "I'm going to the viewing room to make a copy of the tape."</p>

<p>"Sure, Dave" Samantha replied, as she sat down at the desk. "I'll place a phone-call back to the island; remember Ted told us to call him after the conference?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's right."</p>

<p>Dave went off with the videocassette, and Samantha dialed the number from one of the newsroom telephones. As the phone rang on the other line, she balanced the receiver on one shoulder and began typing her script for the wildlife convention story.</p>

<p>Back on Tropical Island, Ted Hughes was speaking to one of the other reporters when the phone rang. "...I'll need that write-up for the 11 o'clock news... WCAT City Desk." he said, answering the phone.</p>

<p>"Ted, it's Samantha."</p>

<p>"West, good. What's the news over there?" His voice was brisk.</p>

<p>"The conference is over; we're at our Vaharis bureau right now. Dave is copying the tape; the film footage should be in the network system any minute now."</p>

<p>"Excellent." Ted told her, plucking a press release from the fax machine on his desk and skimming through it. "I want that report for the evening news. It'll also be airing on the mainland. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as a matter of fact," Samantha said, "We spoke with a park ranger at the conference who said that arctic foxes are becoming scarcer. Yet Governor Ulrich says the foxes are having a population boom and even announced plans to get them delisted."</p>

<p>Ted was intrigued. "Really?" he said, placing the press release to the side. "That's odd. Our governor, here on the island, always consults with the forest rangers before making a statement of that kind."</p>

<p>"I can just <em>feel</em> there's a story here - a good one." Samantha said excitedly. "I would love to stay here a while longer and look into it; dig around and see who's not telling the truth and why."</p>

<p>"Well," Ted considered, "there hasn't been much news around Faunaville or the rest of Tropical Island lately. All right, you and Dave can stay and investigate this, but if you haven't turned up anything else in a week you're both coming back here."</p>

<p>"Ok, that's great! Thanks"</p>

<p>"I want one of you to call me every couple of days," he told her, glancing at the clock on the wall. "This way I can make sure the two of you are ok and keep updated on the progress you're making."</p>

<p>"Will do," she answered.</p>

<p>Hanging up, Samantha instantly spied Dave returning and waved him over.</p>

<p>"Is the script done?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Almost," said Samantha. "Dave, I just got off the phone. Our editor is letting us stay here for another week to investigate the fox story."</p>

<p>"Hey, great!" replied Dave, "...listen, I spoke with the weatherman back there, and he's forecasting a snow storm, tonight."</p>

<p>"A <em>snow storm</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, he says it's blowing in from the tundra."</p>

<p>"We'd better hurry back, then."</p>

<p>Samantha typed the end notation into the script, a 30 bordered by two dashes, and then printed it. As it came out of the printer, she handed it to Dave.</p>

<p>"Don't worry; I'll have the film edited in a jiffy," the photographer declared.</p><hr>

<p>Snow was billowing down already and plows were beginning to emerge, attempting to clear the way for Vaharis' restless traffic. Visibility was very low which made it a hassle to drive.</p>

<p>The full force of the storm hit, however, upon their arrival at the lodge. Samantha and Dave had barely stepped out of the car when a gust of bitter arctic wind seized them; Samantha had to hold on to her hat to keep the gale from stealing it. Trying to shield each other from the brunt of the storm, they hurried to unlock the cabin door and sought shelter in the warmth of the interior.</p>

<p>Dave shut the door behind them, then called out, "Gero, we're home!"</p>

<p>Only silence responded.</p>

<p>"That's funny," he remarked. "Doesn't Geronimo usually come running when we arrive?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he's still sulking." Samantha shivered, leaning against the door. "Dave...is the thermostat turned down? It seems awfully cold in here."</p>

<p>"I'll go check."</p>

<p>He went upstairs; Samantha was about to follow him when her eyes caught sight of movement near one of the windows. <em>Were the curtains swaying...?</em> Approaching curiously, she found that the window was open...open wide enough to permit a cat to <em>escape</em>.</p>

<p>"Dave!"</p>

<p>The cameraman instantly appeared at the stairs. He glanced from Samantha to the open window; in one quick motion, he went to her and shut it. They both stared at each other. At last Dave spoke up, "You don't think..."</p>

<p>Before he had finished his sentence, the reporter was dashing to the door. He went after her. "Samantha!"</p>

<p>She didn't listen, instead flinging open the door. Snow stung her eyes, and the wind blew fiercely at her hair and clothes, but she fought against it and called out, "Geronimo! <em>Geronimo</em>!"</p>

<p>"Sam, it's pointless," Dave said. He gently held her by the shoulders and pulled her inside. "The wind is blowing too hard. We'd never find him tonight."</p>

<p>"I can't just leave him out there..." her voice trailed.</p>

<p>Dave closed the door and hugged her for a long time. He looked in her eyes and said, "Don't worry. Geronimo's a smart cat. He'll be ok. Tomorrow we can go out and look for him if he hasn't come back by morning."</p>

<p>"First thing," said Samantha. She loosened herself from his embrace and silently went up the stairs to the bedroom.</p><h3>Chapter 5 - Snowstorm</h3>

<p>Geronimo had never seen weather like this. Brutal cold seeped into his short fur, violent winds not unlike those of a hurricane lashed out mercilessly - but what kind of hurricane was this? There was no rain, only frigid flakes that whirled at him, clouding his vision in a wall of white.</p>

<p>Snow was unknown to Geronimo, who had lived all his life on Tropical Island. He struggled against it, his paws sinking into the powder at each step. The icy wind singed his whiskers and each time he pushed forward, its force made progress an impossibility. It howled through the forest, like a pack of hungry wolves. Desperate now, he tried to run, yet in that same instant a strong gust of wind blew at him, effortlessly picking up the fighting feline and hurling him backwards.</p>

<p>He extended his claws, catching hold of the trunk of a tree, but his claws just splintered the bark and the storm flung him against a nearby pine. The snow that had accumulated on the needles dropped suddenly with the impact and Geronimo - envisioning himself being trapped underneath - attempted to leap away, only to be jerked back. His collar had caught on one of the branches and suddenly the fight to seek shelter became a fight to survive. Panicking, he writhed around, but the thin strap kept a tight hold, choking him...</p>

<p>"Cat!" Geronimo was nudged suddenly by a white muzzle. Looking up, he stared into the amber eyes of the fluffy white creatures he had observed from the window. The one who had spoken was the male. "Hey, cat! Relax! Don't panic...just pull back <em>slowly</em>..."</p>

<p>Geronimo, dizzy from the hold on his neck and confused from the cold, did as the critter told him; the collar slipped off and Geronimo was free.</p>

<p>"Thanks..." Geronimo mewed, his voice hoarse.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out in this weather?" the female critter asked.</p>

<p>"I can't find my way back..." Another fierce gust howled past and the two white critters blocked it from pushing Geronimo away again. The cat noticed with interest the fur covering their paws, helping them to grip the snow. <em>These critters seem born for this weather.</em></p>

<p>"We can't stay out here," said the male, "Follow me."</p>

<p>The three quickly made their way through the undergrowth, to a thin trail in the woods. Soon, they arrived at a tall pine tree with a burrow ensconced at its roots. One of the critters, the male, approached the opening and lifted his nose to the air. He sniffed for a minute and seeing that all was clear, beckoned to the other two. They swiftly entered the underground den.</p>

<p>One of the first things that struck Geronimo was how the noise of the snowstorm was muffled by the den walls. It faded to a faint, seemingly distant murmur, leaving the den relatively silent except for the thin crackle of gravel. In the semidarkness Geronimo could just make out the figures of the two animals, sitting close by and watching him.</p>

<p>"It's very cramped," said the female, gesturing with her tail to indicate the burrow. "Our original den was more spacious. It had twenty-one tunnel entrances all across the tundra."</p>

<p>Geronimo, still trembling from the cold, didn't respond. He had never heard of a den as large as what she recounted. The male critter spoke up, "My name is Ivan...this is my mate, Natasha."</p>

<p>"I'm Geronimo," the cat introduced himself. "Excuse me, but...what type of critters are you?"</p>

<p>"We're arctic foxes," answered Ivan.</p>

<p>"I've never seen foxes with white fur."</p>

<p>"Oh, we turn brown in the summertime," said Natasha.</p>

<p>Geronimo still looked perplexed; Ivan explained, "Every winter our coats become white so we can hide in the snow. Come summer, we shed it all and our fur turns short and brown."</p>

<p>"Then we should be safe from..." Natasha stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>Geronimo was looking at her expectantly, so she finished awkwardly, "...the snow...and the blizzards."</p>

<p>"You mean that cold sand everywhere?"</p>

<p>"Cold sand?" she echoed.</p>

<p>"That freezing white stuff falling from the sky."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's snow - and a snowstorm that is really bad is called a blizzard. You don't seem to be from around here," she remarked with interest.</p>

<p>"I'm from Tropical Island." Geronimo responded.</p>

<p>"I've heard of that place," said Ivan. "The warblers fly there for the winter. They tell me it's a very warm place with coconuts...whatever coconuts are. But they say the humans there are nice to animals. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"All the humans I've ever met, are." meowed Geronimo. "The warblers tell stories of the north, too. They spoke of snow, but I never imagined it was like this."</p>

<p>"It's not that bad," yapped Natasha. "Just wait until the snow storm subsides."</p>

<p>"Then you can head back to your den," Ivan added.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure where it is," admitted Geronimo.</p>

<p>The foxes looked at each other briefly and then back at the cat. Ivan spoke up. "You were wearing a collar, so you must have a human companion, right?"</p>

<p>"Oh...yes" hesitated Geronimo.</p>

<p>"So. You probably live in one of those dens just outside of the forest." offered Natasha.</p>

<p>"They call them cabins; a lodging place for humans who are visiting this area. I slipped out the window to inspect the woods and now I'm lost." Geronimo sighed; then continued, "I saw you two wandering around yesterday and since I had never seen white foxes, curiosity got the best of me and..."</p>

<p>"...and here you are now." chimed in Natasha.</p>

<p>"I know where that human settlement is" said Ivan. "In the morning, Natasha and I will show you how to get back."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Really." Geronimo purred.</p>

<p>"You're shivering," observed the vixen. "Ivan...he'll freeze. He doesn't have enough layers of fur, yet."</p>

<p>"Natty, you lie on one side of him and I on the other. He'll be in between us like we do to fox kits, to keep them warm."</p>

<p>And so, as the arctic winds howled outside, the three critters slept warmly and soundly inside the den.</p><hr>

<p>In the heart of Vaharis, oblivious to the storm raging outside, Governor Victor Ulrich was in his office watching the evening news. There was a large television set situated to the left of his desk, which he used to keep up with news broadcasts. Standing in front of the TV, he was focused intently on the screen as he lazily smoked a cigarette. He didn't notice the cat Roxanne slink through the open door and curl up behind a tall, potted plant. It was Mabel's cat. The governor couldn't care less about Roxanne. As far as he was concerned, Roxanne was little more than an annoyance with no appreciable value.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, his mind was on the news story regarding the wildlife convention. His cool countenance scarcely betrayed the fury he felt upon hearing that one of the park rangers had dared speak up in opposition to his statement, and as the reporter signed off, Ulrich murmured, "Troublemaker."</p>

<p>Quick steps preceded the arrival of a lady at the office entrance; she had the tense air of one about to announce something, but noticing the governor's silence and the news broadcast on the television, she smirked instead.</p>

<p>"You've heard," she said, stepping into the office. "I was just coming to tell you."</p>

<p>"That ranger is severely mistaken if he thinks he can interfere," said Ulrich.</p>

<p>The woman wrapped her arms around him. "I trust you'll persuade him to see the error of it?"</p>

<p>"If convenient." A complacent smile crossed his lips. "Let him talk for now. I <em>will</em> get those foxes delisted...and there's nothing he can do about it."</p>

<p>The lady narrowed her eyes. "He can make noise and create trouble. For all of us."</p>

<p>"Denise Ralston," the governor mused, "are you worried this barking dog might actually bite?"</p>

<p>"Only that he'll alert the rest of the pack," Denise replied.</p>

<p>Ulrich turned his attention back to the television. "They'll never find out those statistics were falsified."</p>

<p>From behind the plant, Roxanne let out a hiss. <em>Scoundrel, </em>she thought. <em>Who's worse, she or he? </em></p>

<p>"I missed you, last night" Denise whispered.</p>

<p>"You know I can't be in two places at once, unfortunately," answered Ulrich, "My wife, Mabel and I had tickets to the opera..."</p>

<p>"Mabel, always Mabel," interrupted Denise. Her face turned red with anger.</p>

<p>"Yes; Mabel is my wife," the governor quickly responded. "You had better come to terms with that issue. She has inherited millions, remember?"</p>

<p>Denise Ralston was treasurer of the region's funds. She was a rather tall woman, approximately the governor's height, with blonde hair, blue eyes and a mean-spirited personality. Denise was all about money. She cared about little else except her looks and luxury. She had first met the governor at his inauguration, about two years ago, and an affair began soon afterwards. Love was not the issue.</p>

<p>Her demeanor softened and her viper instincts took over. She said, "Well, let me leave you with a memory of what you missed."</p>

<p>She kissed him passionately and he responded by drawing her closer to his body. Roxanne the cat was frizzed and fuming mad. <em>I wish I could get my claws on her, </em>she thought. The cat crept out of the office silently.</p>

<p>As Roxanne walked down the hallway, she came across a young man who bent down to pet her.</p>

<p>“Hello, you beautiful feline!” he said. “What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Roxanne,” replied the cat, “and your name is Luke Theron, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he replied. “Do you know where I can find the office of Denise Ralston?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Roxanne, “you’re standing in front of it. She’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Ok, thanks,” answered Theron as the cat wandered off.</p>

<p>Back in the governor’s office, Ulrich said, "Go finish those financial reports. I need them in the morning. Those pesky reporters might show up asking questions."</p>

<p>"Ugh." Denise grimaced. "What <em>is</em> this? Cat hair!" She picked at a couple of fine hairs sticking to her silk blouse. "When will you finally get rid of that annoying animal?"</p>

<p>"Denny, you know she belongs to Mabel. She loves that cat. Why, I'll never know."</p>

<p>"Don't call me Denny. My name is Denise," she burst out angrily.</p>

<p>"Ok. Denise." He stroked her face and she calmed down.</p>

<p>"Let me take care of the cat," encouraged Denise. "This way, we won't have to worry about snoops or snitches."</p>

<p>"That cat is too stupid to care," answered Ulrich.</p>

<p>Denise smiled; turned and walked out the door. Ulrich shut off the television set and sitting down at his desk, started shuffling through some papers.</p>

<p>As Denise approached her office, she noticed a man waiting in front of the door and recognized him immediately.</p>

<p>“What the hell are you doing here?” she asked angrily. “You’re not supposed to come here.”</p>

<p>“Gorgonio and Venancio were getting antsy, and asked me to come and talk to you about…” Theron began.</p>

<p>“I don’t give a damn,” interrupted Denise. “Go back and tell them whatever they have to say can wait till the meeting.”</p>

<p>She went into her office and slammed the door in his face.</p>

<p>Theron took a deep breath, turned and left.</p><h3>Chapter 6 - The Wildlife Poachers</h3>

<p>The snow storm subsided in the morning, leaving the forest still and peaceful under its shimmering cover of snow. Ivan the fox poked his head out of the den and looked around; satisfied, he hopped out and scratched behind an ear. Geronimo scrambled out of the den immediately after, his blue eyes wide with fascination. "Why is it always so dim here? Doesn't the sun ever come out?"</p>

<p>"It's winter," replied Natasha as she emerged from the burrow. "The sun comes out, but it's usually opaque since the snow clouds cover it. It comes out for a much longer time during the summer. Isn't it like that everywhere?"</p>

<p>"Back on Tropical Island, the sun would always shine brightly in the daytime." explained Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Wow, that must be so weird!" Natasha yapped, intrigued. "No snow, constantly-bright sun. How can anyone there tell what season it is?"</p>

<p>"We need to get moving," Ivan interrupted suddenly. "The sooner we can make it to the cabin, the better."</p>

<p>"Hey, there's no rush," purred Geronimo. "If we know where the lodge is, there's no reason why we can't idle on our way. I'm still checking out the snow."</p>

<p>"But don't you want to be reunited with your humans?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am hungry. If I get back before they go out somewhere, they'll feed me."</p>

<p>The three set off down the forest path, Ivan taking the lead. The forest was beautiful blanketed in snow. It glittered as if wrapped in a sheet of diamonds; Geronimo, enthralled by it all, dashed ahead and leapt into the bank. "<em>Meow</em>! I love snow!"</p>

<p>Ivan looked as if he was going to protest, but Natasha pounced on him playfully and the two foxes began sprinting happily, like kits scampering around in the snow until - as if the same thing had crossed their minds - they abruptly stopped, glancing around nervously.</p>

<p>Geronimo ran over to them, his fur fluffed from the cold and his whiskers twitching excitedly. "Something wrong?"</p>

<p>"<em>No</em>...not really" Natasha responded. "But we shouldn't be making so much noise."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Natasha appeared to be searching for an answer; it was Ivan who replied, "If we make too much noise, we'll scare off all the prey."</p>

<p>"Mice?" asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Lemmings," Ivan answered happily.</p>

<p>"They're like fat mice with no tails." Natasha explained, as they continued down the trail.</p>

<p>"They sound familiar," Geronimo mewed thoughtfully. "I think I remember hearing somewhere that they commit mass suicide. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"It's true, all right," Ivan yapped.</p>

<p>"Lemmings are nuts," said Natasha. "They breed like rabbits until one day they all lose it and they run to the Whirlpool River - close by here - to jump. They're bold, too. Heaven help the critter they run afoul of. They've been known to stand up to Musk Oxen and Caribou a hundred times their size! Incidentally," she said, stepping in front of Geronimo and staring at him, her voice becoming ominously serious, "<em>never</em> anger a lemming."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. <em>Okay...</em>" Geronimo meowed; then, stepping around her, asked, "So, is there anything else to eat around here that's not deranged?"</p>

<p>"Anything you can find," Ivan shrugged.</p>

<p>"Is that why you left the tundra? A food shortage?"</p>

<p>"Mostly," Ivan murmured.</p>

<p>They had now reached a point where the trail veered off, becoming narrower and bordered by dry bracken and pine trees. The woods were soothingly tranquil here, the only sound being the brush of their paws through the snow and distant birdsong. "You had mentioned your humans were here visiting," remarked Natasha.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah." Geronimo meowed, strutting ahead importantly with his tail held high, "They're journalists. The two of them are here covering some kind of a conference."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the male fox.</p>

<p>"...And they actually brought you with them on their journey?" added the vixen.</p>

<p>"Well...not intentionally. I hid in their luggage." Geronimo purred sneakily. "Everyone was upset at first, but they got over it quickly and..."</p>

<p>"Geronimo, look out!" Natasha shrieked suddenly.</p>

<p>There was a flash of silver and letting out a screech, Geronimo leapt straight up in the air at the same time that cruel, steel jaws lunged hungrily from the snow like a piranha, snapping together audibly with a crushing force.</p>

<p>Without warning, two gunshots exploded from the bushes; the foxes instinctually ducked and the bullets barely missed their heads. Instead, they hit the bark of a nearby tree, showering them with thin shards of wood. "Run for it!" Natasha barked.</p>

<p>Geronimo - stunned and confused - tried to dash forward, but more sharp teeth barred his way, springing up from the ground uncontrollably and making his ears ring with their harsh snapping noise. "It's a trap line!" Ivan yapped at him, just as another shot was fired. "This way!"</p>

<p>He dove into the bracken, Natasha on his heels; Geronimo threw himself after them, his heart pounding and his mind reeling. They had just emerged from the brush when Geronimo felt his heart momentarily stop. A man stood only a short distance away, aiming a rifle directly at them.</p>

<p>"Missed us?" he sneered to the two foxes.</p>

<p>Ivan turned sharply, kicking up snow. The man fired but misjudging their exact location, failed to hit them as they dashed off. "They're heading that way!" the man shouted to other hunters.</p>

<p>Geronimo could hear gunfire from behind, acutely aware of the dangerous proximity at which each bullet fell. As the foxes bounded a fallen tree, their bushy tails streaming out behind them, Geronimo swiftly took the lead; weaving this way and that, running as fast as his body could withstand, until...</p>

<p>He stopped as he found himself at the edge of a precipice, dislodging pebbles which clattered down the steep rock into the raging water below. As the full image came into view, Geronimo saw that it was a gorge, whose craggy walls divided the forest from the city. Below, the frothy white water spun viciously to a vortex, creating dozens of them, each whirlpool threatening to devour anything that fell in its menacing grasp. To their left, far from where they stood, a large suspension bridge crossed from one side to the other, but the chasm was too wide to jump.</p>

<p>A gunshot from behind startled Geronimo and the foxes.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Ivan yapped to the others, leaping off the cliff. He landed squarely on a rocky ledge jutting out below; from there he bounded to another one. Geronimo - still trying to catch his breath - followed without hesitation, as did Natasha. They leapt from one ledge to another, making a steady and rapid descent, until Ivan halted unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Before them, the cliff wall turned sheer, stranding them on a narrow shelf halfway down.</p>

<p>Ivan turned to Geronimo, dismay flickering in his amber eyes. "Geronimo," he said, "there's something we haven't told you."</p>

<p>"No kidding!" the tomcat hissed.</p>

<p>At that moment, a gunshot from above took everyone by surprise; gravel rained down onto their fur as the bullet missed and hit the cliff instead. Looking up, Geronimo felt his claws unsheathe, scraping the smooth surface of the ledge. Standing at the top of the cliff, his rifle pointed at them, was one of the hunters.</p>

<p>It was only now that Geronimo could get a good look at him. He was slim - slightly older than Samantha and Dave - with sharp features framed by wavy dark brown hair that covered half his ears, and dark brown eyes with a somehow merciless quality. As Geronimo watched, he was joined at the precipice by two other men - one had short blond hair with brown eyes, rather young; the other was heavyset, with blue eyes and hair that was shaved down to stubs. Both were also armed with rifles.</p>

<p>The youngest of the hunters looked over the edge of the cliff. "Forget it, Gorgonio," he said. "You'll never get the pelts back up here. And the cat's a trash kill."</p>

<p>"Theron, I don't care if they fall into the river and <em>drown</em>," Gorgonio, still aiming at the animals, snapped back, "I want to see them <em>dead</em>! Venancio! Take a shot at 'em" he yelled.</p>

<p>The third hunter fired, hitting the ledge the three critters were huddled on. Part of it crumbled into the roaring torrent below; Natasha yelped as she nearly lost her balance.</p>

<p>Gorgonio smiled, his evilness apparent as he reveled in the thought of the torment he was inflicting on the animals. He fired at them again; Ivan growled fiercely at him, though Natasha merely let out a terrified whimper. Geronimo, however, was taking notice of the bridge.</p>

<p>Through their scrambling down the rock face, they had moved nearer to it; Geronimo could somewhat make out the noise from the occasional automobile that crossed the structure. But that was not what had caught the cat's attention. Underneath the bridge was a metal framework that stretched along its length. <em>From there,</em> Geronimo realized, <em>it would be possible to escape onto the bridge!</em></p>

<p>Geronimo crouched down, tensing his body to jump. From behind him he heard Ivan bark, "What are you doing?!"</p>

<p>"Just follow me!" Geronimo yowled, leaping into the air. For a brief heartbeat, he was over the swirling waters; then he dropped suddenly, barely catching hold of the framework with his forepaws. He could hear gunfire ringing out as he struggled not to lose his grip, his claws screeching on the metal. At last, breathlessly climbing onto the metal bar, he turned back to Ivan and Natasha. The two foxes were pressed against the cliff wall, the shelf they were perched on remarkably thinner than before. "Ivan! Natasha!"</p>

<p>They looked up at the feline, who waved his tail as if gesturing for them to follow his lead. "He's right - that's our only chance," Ivan said, scarcely dodging another bullet.</p>

<p>"Oh...no way!" Natasha shook her head. "I'm not...We'd fall! There are whirlpools..."</p>

<p>"...and if we stay here we'll be shot!" Ivan yapped, nudging her; she leapt - almost in panic - but fell short. She squealed just as Geronimo pounced and seizing the scruff of her neck in his teeth, he pulled her up. Ivan, who was still on the ledge, turned to glare at the three hunters. Gorgonio aimed exactly at him, but in that instant the fox leapt, landing perfectly beside Geronimo; the shot hit where the fox had been standing and what remained of the ledge collapsed into the river.</p>

<p>Safe at last, the three animals crawled along the steel frame and onto the bridge. Gorgonio tried to aim at them, but didn't fire. "They're too far away. Shit!" he snarled, thrusting down the rifle in fury.</p>

<p>Geronimo had by now, managed to catch his breath. The animals looked on as the hunters retreated into the woods.</p>

<p>"That was close," said Natasha.</p>

<p>Ivan didn't say anything, only licking her behind the ear comfortingly. The two foxes then glanced over at the cat, who was roughly trying to smooth down his frizzed fur. Sensing the foxes' watchful eyes, Geronimo looked up.</p>

<p>"We owe you an explanation." Ivan said quietly.</p>

<p>Geronimo flicked an ear. "Who were those people and why were they shooting at us?"</p>

<p>Ivan swished his bushy tail around, so that it curled around his paws. "We are being hunted," he responded.</p>

<p>"It was because of them that we had to flee the tundra," Natasha continued. "My ancestors had built their den here and it had been passed down throughout generations of foxes. Then one day those men found it. They destroyed it."</p>

<p>"We have seen them do terrible things," Ivan said. "Things that are...pointless."</p>

<p>Geronimo stared at them for a moment, as if expecting a further explanation, but both foxes stayed silent. "So what will you do?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"The only thing we can." Ivan replied. "<em>Run</em>."</p><h3>Chapter 7 - Gotcha</h3>

<p>Samantha and Dave had gone into the forest to search for their missing feline. It was still rather early and there were a few trails through the woods where the snow was not very deep, affording relative ease in travel.</p>

<p>Samantha nonetheless felt despondent. Dave - hoping at the least to offer a small distraction - reminded her that they still had not filmed any of the northern wildlife and that it would be an excellent addition to any follow-up reports they did, so they might as well do so now since they were going into the forest anyway. This cheered her up a bit, but her spirits fell once more when they came across Geronimo's collar snagged on the lower branch of a pine tree.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that's that," she sighed, gently retrieving it from the branch.</p>

<p>"Samantha, I'm sure he hasn't gone far..." Dave's voice trailed off somewhat as she turned her vivid green gaze to him. Neither she nor he, truly believed those words, no matter how much they wanted to.</p>

<p>At last, Samantha spoke, "Now people will think he's a stray."</p>

<p>"Not if they speak to him," Dave pointed out. "He could always tell them he's got humans."</p>

<p>"That's true," Samantha acknowledged; then seeming to cheer up, added, "And if they have a television set all he has to do is point us out."</p>

<p>The pair felt happier after that and decided to continue down the trail.</p>

<p>Winter had enveloped the woodland and as Samantha and Dave were walking along, they made their way to a part of the forest where the pines dissipated and before them was a treeless, snow-covered meadow. The snow here was wind-swept, and although the gale of last night had long since died down, every so often a small gust would blow past and lift a few of the snowflakes from the ground. The land - though mostly flat - would slope in sections, but with the snow cover it was difficult to say at a glance whether these were piles of snow or the territory itself.</p>

<p>As Dave started the film rolling, Samantha narrated into the microphone: "We're at the edge of the forest. Over there is the unchanged wilderness where the foxes live; the backdrop for political debate over whether to delist the arctic fox."</p>

<p>She paused and the two stared out at the landscape, which stretched into the distance. Samantha remarked, "It's strange, Dave...such a desolate territory, and yet it seems ethereal. The silence has a strange beauty all its own."</p>

<p>"Well, I got a shot of it. It <em>is</em> beautiful, though rather barren." Dave said.</p>

<p>"That's the tundra," a familiar voice interjected; the reporter and cameraman both glanced over to see the park ranger they had met at yesterday's conference. "The trees can't grow any farther than this point because the ground over there is frozen solid...permafrost; but come spring when the sun shines warmer the tundra becomes covered in flowers. Those small hills happen as a result of the land freezing and melting."</p>

<p>Samantha smiled. "Ranger Conway...what a surprise, meeting you again, out here!"</p>

<p>Conway shook his head. He went over a few paces to them. "You shouldn't be wandering around alone in the forest like this," he told them. "These woods can be dangerous if you don't know them."</p>

<p>"Oh, we know our way back to the lodge. Right, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Sure, we just head that way," Dave said, pointing left.</p>

<p>Samantha squinted. "No...the lodge is <em>that </em>way," she corrected, pointing right.</p>

<p>"The Crossing Lodge?" When both Samantha and Dave nodded, Conway pointed straight ahead.</p>

<p>The reporter and cameraman chuckled in mild embarrassment. "So...did Governor Ulrich ever contact you about the fox population?" Samantha asked.</p>

<p>"No, he never did," said Conway, thoughtfully. "I suppose he's a very busy man, but I found something rather disconcerting."</p>

<p>"What did you find?"</p>

<p>Conway hesitated and then answered, "Well...since you're here anyway, I might as well show you."</p>

<p>The park ranger led them down the trail, through the pines, to the base of a tree trunk. Here, he bent down and collected a small metal shell lying in the snow; he showed it to them. "See this?" he said, as Dave began filming. "This is a bullet casing. This type is from a rifle mostly used to hunt furbearing animals, because it won't cause much damage to the pelt. Animals like arctic foxes."</p>

<p>"Could they have been hunting some other animal?"</p>

<p>"There are others in these woods...mink, arctic hare. I had thought for a moment they were after one of those, but then I found <em>this</em>." Conway drew back an overhanging pine branch to reveal steel traps buried in the snow. "Fox traps." Conway said. "And not just any fox traps. These are steel-jawed leghold traps, which were outlawed after being deemed <em>inhumane</em>. These few have already been snapped shut, so apparently some lucky animal escaped, but there are more down the trap line that haven't been triggered yet. I believe someone is after arctic foxes for their fur, and doesn't care how they go about getting it. This isn't just a minor violation," he added, turning to look at the reporter and cameraman. "This is poaching."</p><hr>

<p>"<em>Poaching</em>?!" Governor Victor Ulrich appeared shocked.</p>

<p>After their conversation with the park ranger, Samantha and Dave had gone to the governor's mansion to interview Ulrich about the matter. As luck would have it, they found him outside his office, where he showed them in politely. If he had any reservations about speaking with them, he did not betray it, but he took interest when he heard of the discovery in Hammond Forest. "Outrageous!" the governor declared, standing up from his seat. "Rest assured that if this is true, I will not let those poachers go unpunished. I'm ordering a full investigation into this."</p>

<p>Samantha jotted something down in her notepad. "At the conference, you refused to comment on allegations that the arctic fox population was declining. Do you think that poaching could be creating a perceived decline?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely <em>not</em>." Ulrich hurried to say. "The fox population has increased markedly after I enacted legislation to protect them. No poachers are going to ruin the chances of these beautiful little animals getting off the endangered species list and becoming the next wildlife success story. I'll see to it personally." He smiled. "Ms. West, Mr. Candid, thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. You're doing an excellent job" he told them, shaking the perplexed journalists' hands.</p>

<p>"...Thank you." Samantha said, a bit wary of why, Ulrich - who had just yesterday seemed so aloof with them - now seemed to be so talkative and friendly. She sensed an icy animosity in his tone of voice. She didn't trust him.</p>

<p>As the two were leaving, Samantha had an afterthought, "Ranger Conway had been hoping you would contact him regarding this."</p>

<p>Ulrich replied smoothly, "I can assure you, Ms. West...he'll hear from me."</p>

<p>Samantha still had the uneasy feeling there was something strange about the way Ulrich had acted as she and her companion stepped out of the office.</p>

<p>No sooner had the TV news crew left, however, that Governor Ulrich began quickly dialing the telephone on his desk. "Gorgonio? ...You three are the most <em>incompetent</em> people I have ever hired! I don't pay you to do sloppy work and let your trap lines get discovered by park rangers! Now I've got the media in here asking questions and...damn right it concerns you!"</p>

<p>At that moment, the governor's cell phone rang. "Hold on!" he screamed at Gorgonio. He recognized the number on the phone's screen and answered with a friendly demeanor. "Well, hello...nice hearing from you, Ambassador Qiang."</p>

<p>The voice on the other end answered quickly. It was a man who spoke with an Asian accent.</p>

<p>"Ulrich. Tonight we have the meeting. 11 o'clock. Same place. You have the goods?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course." responded the governor, "I assume you have the cash?"</p>

<p>"As usual" the voice answered.</p>

<p>"Later, then" said Ulrich. He hung up the cell phone and returned to the telephone call.</p>

<p>"Gorgonio, you idiot. You and your men had better get on the ball. I don't pay for mistakes. That nosy ranger Conway found traps. He's a problem and I want him taken care of. That's an extra three percent of the cut for each of you; and don't forget the meeting tonight at 11 p.m., same place. Got it?" Ulrich didn't wait for a response; he just hung up the phone.</p>

<p>On the other end of the line, Gorgonio also hung up the telephone. He turned around and faced the other two, Theron and Venancio; with a smirk on his face.</p>

<p>"It's all set. He's got another job for us, though." he said.</p>

<p>"Different type fur?" asked Venancio. "We'd need different traps."</p>

<p>"No. We'll be hunting human," answered their leader.</p>

<p>Theron jumped in, "Hey. I'm not sure about that. Human?"</p>

<p>Gorgonio grabbed him by the collar and yelled in his ear, "Three percent <em>extra</em>! Are you sure about <em>that</em>!?"</p>

<p>He released him and continued talking. "We need to be more careful, Ulrich said that some reporters were asking questions and that's really got him pissed off."</p>

<p>"Who exactly are we supposed to <em>deal</em> with?" asked Venancio.</p>

<p>"Conway" said Gorgonio. "That ranger has been a pain in the ass since the start. Theron, you're good with electronics. Rig up a gadget that we could put to his car. You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Yeah boss... No problem." replied Theron hesitantly.</p>

<p>Gorgonio announced, "Listen to me. Think of the money. People kill each other in wars all the time and nobody really gives a damn. It's not our problem. It's our gain."</p><hr>

<p>Back at the governor's mansion, journalists Samantha West and Dave Candid stepped into the hallway where the elevators were. Dave tapped the button and they waited for an elevator heading down. "So, that was it," said Dave. "Poaching. No wonder there was that misconception about the fox population. Well, I guess all stories can't make headlines."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I just can't shake off the feeling that there was something weird about the way Ulrich was behaving back there." Samantha replied pensively. She sighed. "Maybe I'm just being cynical."</p>

<p>The elevator doors opened and as they stepped inside, Dave said, "Don't be too hard on yourself. They say cynicism is one of the best traits for the investigative reporter."</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes flashed with thrilled realization. "Of course...why didn't I think of it before!"</p>

<p>"Think of what?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"What I should have done from the beginning." Samantha responded as the elevator reached the bottom floor. "Check the file cabinets."</p>

<p>The regional Capitol was across the street from the governor's mansion; so the two of them got there swiftly. The clerk at the Records office was a young woman with reddish hair whose name tag read 'Jane'.</p>

<p>She greeted them, "Good afternoon, may I help you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like to see the population reports for the arctic fox, please"</p>

<p>"Which years?"</p>

<p>"The past five."</p>

<p>The clerk turned and disappeared into a door in the back, then reappeared a few minutes later with some papers. She handed them to the reporter.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jane" said Samantha.</p>

<p>The TV news crew began looking though the documents.</p>

<p>"Aha!" Samantha smiled. "All of these documents say that the fox population is extremely low...nothing about any sort of comeback."</p>

<p>"So why would the governor be saying something else?" Dave wondered.</p>

<p>"Yeah...and why would he want the arctic fox delisted?" Samantha glanced up from the documents to meet her companion's eyes. "This might make headlines after all."</p>

<p>They copied the population reports and headed out of the Capitol building.</p><hr>

<p>Governor Ulrich was seated at his desk, reading a letter, when his secretary appeared at the office door. "Governor, the television news crew from WCAT is back; they'd like to speak with you."</p>

<p>Ulrich thought for a moment before laying the letter to the side. "Show them in," he answered.</p>

<p>Only a few moments passed before Samantha appeared at the doorway. "Governor Ulrich?"</p>

<p>"Back so soon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We have a few follow-up questions based on some new information we've received," Samantha explained, as she and Dave stepped inside.</p>

<p>"Oh, really?" Governor Ulrich leaned back in his chair, staring intently at them.</p>

<p>"You're saying that the arctic fox population has increased...?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Ulrich quickly spoke up. "They've made a stunning comeback."</p>

<p>"Do you have anything supporting that?"</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence; eventually, Samantha went on, "We checked arctic fox population reports filed at the regional Capitol, and they all say that the fox population has not made any..."</p>

<p>"They were done before this new study," Ulrich interrupted.</p>

<p>"What study?"</p>

<p>"The study saying that they've rebounded."</p>

<p>"Who did that study?"</p>

<p>"Well...I don't remember right now"</p>

<p>"How long ago was it done?"</p>

<p>"It was done recently," said the governor, now seeming a bit flustered.</p>

<p>"How recently?"</p>

<p>"No...comment."</p>

<p>"No comment?" Samantha tipped her head to one side. "Governor, aren't you worried that not commenting might make it look as if you don't know what you're talking about? ...As if the numbers you cited at the convention were pulled out of thin air?"</p>

<p>Ulrich was visibly angry. "What you're doing has a name. They call it <em>Gotcha</em> Journalism."</p>

<p>Samantha smiled and answered with a whisper, "<em>Gotcha</em>."</p>

<p>Ulrich met her gaze steadily. "Get out of my office. Now!"</p>

<p>The pair knew they had overstayed their welcome and without saying another word, turned around and left the office.</p>

<p>They encountered the park ranger, Conway, speaking with Ulrich's secretary.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, he's unavailable right now," the secretary was saying. "In fact he's all booked for this month."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I make an appointment to speak with him next month?" Conway asked her.</p>

<p>"We don't schedule appointments that far in advance," the secretary answered.</p>

<p>The ranger glanced towards Samantha and Dave, nodded in greeting and they in turn nodded back. The reporter and her cameraman walked out into the hallway, away from the secretary's desk, turned the corner and stayed there with the camera rolling.</p>

<p>At the same time, Mabel was turning the corner at the opposite end of the hallway. She noticed the reporters and the ranger and thought to herself, <em>I wonder what's happening?</em> She decided to hide and observe.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, Ulrich walked out of his office. He seemed in a hurry, but stopped short in his tracks when he saw the ranger.</p>

<p>Ranger Conway turned to face him and said, "Governor, I came to speak to you about the issue of delisting the arctic foxes."</p>

<p>Ulrich interrupted him. "There's nothing to talk about. I've made the decision."</p>

<p>"Based on what information?" responded Conway, anger rising in his voice.</p>

<p>"I don't have to explain myself to you," Ulrich replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not to me, but in an election year you do have to explain yourself to the voters."</p>

<p>Ulrich was visibly annoyed at this statement and answered quickly. "I suppose you think you have the power to make me lose the election? I'm ahead of my opponent according to the polls. I suggest, Ranger, that you go back to your cabin and stick to what you know, keeping track of the squirrels and the rabbits."</p>

<p>"Governor Ulrich, I don't know much about politics or whatever it is you're getting out of this - but I do know that if you delist those foxes now, you're sentencing an entire species to extinction. Their numbers are so low they'd never be able to withstand having a bounty on their pelts, which is exactly what'll happen when the department stores hear open season declared on arctic foxes."</p>

<p>Ulrich focused his icy blue eyes on the park ranger. "<em>I'll</em> decide when they can be delisted."</p>

<p>Samantha leaned forward to hold the microphone closer to the sound. It was then that the microphone cable, which had gotten tangled on her heel, tripped her; she fell and Dave caught her before she hit the ground, but not before Ulrich had glanced up at the commotion out in the hallway.</p>

<p>"I thought I told you fucking journalists to leave!"</p>

<p>Samantha was trying to unravel the cable from her legs, while still holding the microphone out. "Governor, do you mean to say that you don't care whether or not there are enough foxes to safely delist them?"</p>

<p>Ulrich ignored the question. "I won't stand for this any longer. Get out of my office before I call security."</p>

<p>Ranger Conway spoke up again, distracting the governor. "Is there some reason you don't want the press here?" By this time, Samantha had gotten her legs free from the cable, and together with Dave had made their way towards the ongoing quarrel.</p>

<p>"Are you in cahoots with the press?" Ulrich retorted.</p>

<p>"No. But the more I hear, the more I realize that you stink," said Conway.</p>

<p>"Your opinion is of no concern to me."</p>

<p>"You should value my opinion, Governor, because I'm not just a ranger. I'm a concerned citizen and I vote."</p>

<p>"Your one vote is not going to decide the election. Get out of the building before I have you arrested..." Ulrich paused and gave an irritated look to the TV news crew. Dave was recording the spat, while Samantha was in between the ranger and governor, shifting the microphone alternately from one to the other. "...and shut that damn camera off!" Ulrich added to the photographer.</p>

<p>Dave did not. Samantha was the one who replied, pointing the microphone back to Ulrich after her question: "We're in a public building, funded by public dollars. Don't we have the right to film here?"</p>

<p>"Not when a publicly elected official tells you to leave," he retorted. Before Samantha could dispute the legality of this, he grabbed her firmly by the arm and half-led, half-pushed her back out into the hallway; Dave followed, still filming. "I have had enough of your sensationalized, unscrupulous excuse for journalism. The elevators are that way. And as for you..." he turned with a glare towards Conway.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving," said Conway. "Fuck you."</p>

<p>A look that was both indescribable and unexplainable to the journalists crossed Ulrich's eyes for a fleeting second, but it was gone almost instantly. Ulrich shrugged his shoulders and said nothing in response.</p>

<p>Conway walked off, and Ulrich turned to head back into his office. He stopped at the entrance and murmured something to his secretary, who nodded. The reporters chased after the park ranger.</p>

<p>"Ranger Conway!"</p>

<p>Conway stopped and let Samantha and Dave catch up with him. "Hi guys." He appeared disenchanted.</p>

<p>"Do you have any comment for our viewers?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"I made a mistake," he said. "I thought that maybe the governor didn't know what was going on, but I think it's clear now that what happens to the foxes just doesn't matter to him. Why he would be so hell-bent on delisting them is beyond me." Conway glanced from the reporter to the cameraman. "When I met you two in the forest earlier today, I started thinking about how Governor Ulrich never called me back and decided that with poachers after the foxes, I couldn't let this be ignored any more. Now I see it makes no difference."</p>

<p>"The Ministry of Wildlife gets its numbers on animal populations from the rangers, doesn't it?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"Yes, and also from biologists stationed in different areas where the animals are located. They sort through the info and then the Minister of Wildlife signs saying whether or not the animal is scarce or abundant."</p>

<p>She showed the ranger the population reports she and Dave had copied. "Well, the Wildlife Ministry records agree with you. They say arctic fox numbers are so low, they can't be delisted."</p>

<p>Conway gave her a surprised look. "But if that's the case, then the foxes can't legally be delisted. The governor can only delist them when the Ministry of Wildlife says the population is strong enough to be able to thrive."</p>

<p>"Why would the governor make the show of announcing plans to delist the fox if he can't do it?" Samantha asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe he wants the publicity," Conway said. "Although wouldn't a lie that ostentatious, harm more than help in an election year?"</p>

<p><em>Unless there's something we don't know,</em> Samantha thought.</p>

<p>Samantha thanked the ranger for taking the time to speak with them and finished the interview. When the TV news crew had left, Mabel, who had been hiding and listening, approached Conway.</p>

<p>"Ranger," Mabel called out to him, "may I have a word with you, please?"</p>

<p>Conway looked at her with surprise and said, "Mrs. Ulrich, how may I help you?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help but overhear the conversation you had with my husband," Mabel began. "Dare I say that I agree with you. It seems that not so long ago, our region's wildlife was better protected from poaching."</p>

<p>Conway looked at her without saying a word. He was speechless.</p>

<p>Mabel continued, "It is my sincere wish that the truth come out, regardless of who's right or wrong."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Mrs. Ulrich; I hope the governor will come to think the way you do," responded Conway.</p>

<p>Mabel turned the corner and was gone; Conway proceeded to the elevator, thinking, <em>That is a very graceful and beautiful lady. How did she end up with a guy like Ulrich?</em></p><hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Ulrich had gone back into his office and began dialing the telephone. The other line rang three times before a man's voice answered:</p>

<p>"Washburn speaking."</p>

<p>"Why the hell haven't you changed those documents?" Ulrich was furious.</p>

<p>"I've had time to think about it, Ulrich. I want nothing to do with the matter." Washburn answered. "You know how fast our careers would be destroyed if we falsify those records and people found out?"</p>

<p>Ulrich scoffed. "What makes you think people would ever find out? Or that if they found out, they would even care?"</p>

<p>There was silence on Washburn's line for a moment before he replied: "I'm not signing those documents. The foxes are endangered."</p>

<p>"You'll sign those documents within 48 hours," Ulrich told him, and hung up the phone.</p>

<p>On the other end of the line, Washburn set the phone receiver down; he felt a sudden moment of fear.</p>

<p><em>What did Ulrich mean with that last sentence? He wouldn't dare do anything to me; I'm in a superior position than he is. Still, I wonder if I should talk to somebody about this.</em></p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the telephone ringing, and still in shock, he lifted the receiver and simply said hello.</p>

<p>The voice on the other end of the line was cheerful and came through clearly. "Why the change in your usual greeting? Is everything okay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've just been very busy," he answered, "but never too busy to speak to my beautiful wife."</p>

<p>"Well," she continued, "if I remember correctly we had a lunch date today. I'm waiting at the restaurant at the corner."</p>

<p>Washburn straightened up in his seat and said, "Yes, you're right. I'll be there in five minutes" and he hung up the phone.</p>

<p>He grabbed his coat from the back of the chair and walked out of the office.</p><hr>

<p>When Samantha and Dave reached the news van, they played back the tape they had recorded, watching it on the camera's viewfinder. "We got some great footage," Dave said happily.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and some good quotes too." The reporter turned to her cameraman. "But this just seems to be the tip of the iceberg. Ulrich <em>is</em> lying. But <em>why</em>?"</p>

<p>"It certainly doesn't look like it's against his will," Dave analyzed. "Maybe he was bribed, or he's getting kickbacks from whoever's poaching the foxes. Sam, we seem to have stumbled across one hell of a story..."</p>

<p>Dave opened the back door of the news van while Samantha began reviewing her notes. "So, where are we off to now?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"The newsroom," Samantha answered. "I've got to call up the wildlife minister, Mr. Washburn, and see if he'll comment on what the governor's saying. We've also got to fill our editor in on what's been happening. What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Almost 11."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can get it on the News at Noon."</p>

<p>They suddenly heard a distinctive <em>meow</em>; they both glanced over and saw, sitting a small distance away from them in front of an alley, their missing cat.</p>

<p>"Geronimo?" Samantha couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>Geronimo took a big leap and landed in her arms, purring.</p>

<p>"You get around, don't you!" the cat meowed. "What are you doing all the way here?"</p>

<p>"We could ask you the same thing!" laughed Samantha.</p>

<p>"Hey, Ger, about time you turned up." Dave petted him on the head. "We were beginning to get worried."</p>

<p>"Guys, there are some critters I'd like you to meet." Geronimo turned his head, angling his ears towards the alley. Samantha looked in the same direction and stared in complete surprise. Sitting where only moments before Geronimo had been, were two arctic foxes.</p>

<p>Samantha was speechless; Dave quickly brought the camera back up to his shoulder to film. The foxes jumped when the camera's spotlight washed over them. They turned and fled back into the alley.</p>

<p>Geronimo let out a hiss as he leapt out of Samantha's arms and ran after them. "Wait just a minute," he told his humans before they could react.</p>

<p>In the alley, Ivan and Natasha were sneaking away, back the path they had come, until Geronimo got in front of them.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to?" a perplexed Geronimo inquired.</p>

<p>"Back to the forest." said Ivan. "We're glad you found your humans, but we've got to leave already."</p>

<p>"I was hoping you could meet them," said Geronimo.</p>

<p>The two foxes exchanged looks. "We don't think that's a very good idea," said Natasha.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"One of them pointed a gun at us." Ivan yapped, his ears flat.</p>

<p>"A gun? What...no, you're mistaken. That's a TV camera," Geronimo explained. "My humans <em>like</em> critters. They'd never harm you."</p>

<p>"Are you <em>sure</em>?" Natasha said.</p>

<p>"Positive!" Geronimo asserted. When the foxes still seemed doubtful, he added, "At any rate, if anyone can help you with your plight, it's them."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Ivan.</p>

<p>"Well, I bet a lot of humans here don't know the anguish you foxes are going through. Maybe if people know, they'll do something about it. If you want to get rid of those hunters, this is your chance," Geronimo purred.</p>

<p>Geronimo emerged from the alley with the two foxes following him. They were still obviously distrustful of being out in the open and hesitated only a few paces away from where the TV news crew was.</p>

<p>Geronimo walked over to his humans. "These are my humans - Samantha and Dave" Geronimo introduced them.</p>

<p>Samantha crouched down and extended a hand, trying to coax the foxes closer. "Hello" she said.</p>

<p>Ivan crept forward, not taking any notice when Dave resumed filming. Natasha remained at a distance as her mate stood directly in front of Samantha...and snatched her hat.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Samantha tried to grab it back, but the male fox dashed away and hid under their van. Samantha hurried after him and glancing underneath it, found a grinning Ivan with the fedora. "That's my hat," said a clearly amused Samantha.</p>

<p>Natasha, now confident, leapt over and put her forepaws on the reporter's lap. "I'm Natasha," she yapped.</p>

<p>"...and I'm Ivan," the male fox said, emerging with the hat which he dropped at Samantha's feet.</p>

<p>The foxes then ran over to Dave. He had been filming throughout, but now bent down to stroke them.</p>

<p>Geronimo hopped up to sit just inside the van. The back door was still open so he sat down on the floor here, tucking his paws underneath him.</p>

<p>"So this is what you've been up to, befriending endangered species," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"They're endangered?" Geronimo's eyes grew wide. "But they're being hunted."</p>

<p>"Geronimo said you could help us stop the hunting," Ivan barked.</p>

<p>"We've been looking into it," Dave admitted.</p>

<p>"You already know?" mewed Geronimo.</p>

<p>"A source told us this morning." Samantha explained.</p>

<p>"We have to head back," said Natasha. "It was very nice meeting you both."</p>

<p>"You're welcome to drop by the cabin," Samantha told them. "I'll set out dishes of cat food on the porch, tonight."</p>

<p>The foxes opened their eyes wide in surprise and looked at each other happily.</p>

<p>"Thank you. We'll be there," said the male fox.</p>

<p>Ivan and Natasha ran off. As the arctic foxes vanished down the alley, Samantha turned to Dave. “This was fortunate! Dave, did you get all that on camera?”</p>

<p>The cameraman grinned. “Yep! We got some great footage of the foxes.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a loud explosion resonated from across the street and Geronimo leapt up with a surprised meow; smoke filled the street and sirens began blaring through the air.</p>

<p>"What the hell was that?" Dave said.</p>

<p>"A car exploded! Let's get over there," Samantha answered, adding to the cat crouched on the news van's floor: "Geronimo, stay put...please!"</p>

<p>Flames were spouting out of the front of a car that was parked a short distance away and people were running away from it.</p>

<p>The reporter and her cameraman were running towards it, of course. Dave stood as close to it as he could and started filming.</p>

<p>Samantha noticed that on the side of the vehicle were the words "Park Ranger." She looked around and saw Ranger Conway hurrying over from the governor's mansion.</p>

<p>He stopped where they were and said, "My dog! Where's my dog, Zachary?"</p>

<p>They all stared at the car, which by now was engulfed in a ball of fire. At that point, they heard barking and turned around to see a Siberian Husky dog running towards them. It was Zachary.</p>

<p>Dave filmed the joyful reunion as the ranger knelt down and hugged the dog. "Man, am I glad you've got a mind of your own. I'll never tell you to stay in the car alone again."</p>

<p>His canine companion answered him, "Having a sixth sense is a life saver!"</p>

<p>The firefighters arrived and after they had put out the blaze, not much was left of the car. Samantha had a chance to talk with the ranger before the police approached him with questions about the situation.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" she said.</p>

<p>"I'm just stunned..." he responded, staring at the wreckage with complete shock reflected in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Were you having any car trouble before?" Samantha asked.</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't." Conway turned back to her, puzzled. "That's just it - the car was fine."</p>

<p>At that moment, a man came up to them. "I'm Detective Hartcourt. I'd like to have a few words with you," he said to Conway.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," the park ranger told the reporter. He went a small distance away to speak with the detective.</p>

<p>Samantha turned to Dave. "We'd better call this in to the city newsroom, this needs to get on the air; also, we need to call Ted and fill him in."</p>

<p>When she called their affiliate, the editor, Gao, requested that they do the initial report since they were already at the scene. As they began setting things up for the live broadcast, Conway returned.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"The detective said they found that an explosive had been put to the car," said Conway. "Thankfully, it was placed in a way to give enough time for anyone in the car to get out, so whoever put it apparently just meant it as a threat. He asked if I had any known enemies, to which I responded no. But between you and me, I think it could be retaliation for what I said about the foxes."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect someone in particular?" Samantha inquired.</p>

<p>"Not all poaching is done on a small scale." sighed Conway. "The person who ordered this, is probably behind the poaching, but as for <em>who</em> it is, honestly I have no idea." The park ranger suddenly seemed exhausted, as if the transpired events were now taking their toll.</p>

<p>From the governor's mansion, the plume of smoke was visible. Standing at his office window, Ulrich smiled.</p><h3>Chapter 8 - Intrigue</h3>

<p>"Our reporter, Samantha West, is live at the scene...Samantha?"</p>

<p>The image on the television screen flipped to the news reporter. Ulrich wasn't sure whether to be relieved or worried that Samantha was not broadcasting the 'gotcha' moment that had happened today only a while earlier.</p>

<p>His secretary walked into the office. "Excuse me, Governor, I have called the news editor and the appointment has been set up for tomorrow at 10 a.m. His name is Ted Hughes. I was told he'd be flying in from Tropical Island."</p>

<p>Ulrich looked at the calendar on his desk and then wrote the information down in his personal planner. "Thank you," he said without looking up, and closed the booklet.</p>

<p>As the secretary walked out the door, Ulrich looked at the television set in time to hear Samantha finish her report.</p>

<p>"No one was injured in the blast. They're calling this a threat - not an attempt - against Ranger Conway's life. Reporting live, Samantha West, WCAT 8 News."</p>

<p>Ulrich was stupefied. "Damn it!" he yelled. "Those inefficient morons!"</p><hr>

<p>Outside, Geronimo was sitting in the back of the news van watching as Samantha and Dave began taking down their broadcast equipment.</p>

<p>"We never got a chance to call Mr. Washburn for comment, what with all that fuss of Conway's car exploding," Samantha remarked to Dave. "Hopefully he's still at his office."</p>

<p>"Yeah. I wonder why he didn't respond to the governor's announcement about delisting the foxes," Dave said.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's got something to hide," Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>Dave took the tripod and monitors to the van's trunk as Samantha climbed into the back of the news van. Besides the broadcasting and editing equipment, they also had a mobile phone here.</p>

<p>The reporter sat down at the table, and Geronimo leapt up next to her. Samantha spread out the arctic fox population records and opened the latest one to its last page. There was a signature here approving the report's conclusion that the foxes should remain listed as an endangered species, and below this the words:</p>

<p align="center">Mr. Landon Washburn, Minister of Wildlife</p>

<p>Below this, in turn, was the wildlife minister's contact information. Samantha took a pencil and began dialing the telephone.</p>

<p>She got his secretary on the line. "Hello, I'm Samantha West with WCAT 8 News. I was hoping to schedule an interview with the wildlife minister. ...It's just a few questions about the arctic fox population. ...Yes, I'll hold."</p>

<p>Only a few moments had passed before a man's voice answered the phone. "Mr. Washburn speaking."</p>

<p>Samantha re-introduced herself and said, "I'd like to schedule an interview with you for our newscast."</p>

<p>"Regarding the foxes?"</p>

<p>"That's right. Would you be available around noon tomorrow, perhaps, or...?"</p>

<p>Washburn immediately answered, "I can meet with you at 11:30 in the morning. There's something about the fox population I think your viewers should know about."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the reporter, grabbing her notepad.</p>

<p>"I'd prefer to speak with you in person. Do you know the Chinese restaurant on Brook Avenue?"</p>

<p>"The one on the corner of Stanford Street, with big red letters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the one," said Washburn.</p>

<p>"All right," said Samantha. "11:30 a.m. I'll see you then."</p>

<p>When he hung up the telephone, she did so as well. "He'll meet with us around 11:30 at a Chinese restaurant here in Vaharis." Samantha said to Dave. "He said there was something our viewers should know about the fox population."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that is," said Dave.</p>

<p>The phone rang, and interrupted their conversation. Dave answered. It was their editor.</p>

<p>"I was looking for you guys to let you know that you can take the rest of the day off," he said. "You've been working straight away since you got here."</p>

<p>"Thanks Gao," said Dave. "I'll tell Samantha."</p>

<p>He hung up and before he could say another word, Samantha said, "We've got the day off, haven't we...Ok. I'll be working on questions to spring on Washburn."</p>

<p>"Sam...I'm always amazed by your uncanny ability to perceive stuff."</p>

<p>"You do it too, Dave" Samantha replied. "It's a cat thing."</p>

<p>Dave smiled at her. "Rrrrrr" he growled playfully.</p>

<p>Samantha smiled back at him. "Let's go home," she said.</p><hr>

<p>Hidden on a dead-end street in the outskirts of Vaharis' warehouse district was a weather-worn red brick building, situated on an asphalt plot of land. It was surrounded by overgrown holly bushes and numerous storage containers piled one atop the other as if awaiting transport. Towards the back, a wide alleyway divided the warehouse from Hammond Forest; a street lamp beside the building shed a harsh yellow light across the territory.</p>

<p>Hung to the side of the building was a rusty sign that read:</p>

<p align="center">NO TRESPASSING<br />
PROPERTY OF THE NORTENYA REGION</p>

<p>A thin sleet was falling as Governor Victor Ulrich drove up to the warehouse building and parked his car in the alley. The warehouse district was nearly desolate by nightfall.</p>

<p>The asphalt was covered with a mix of snow-melting salt and slush. Ulrich pushed open the unlocked door and stepped inside.</p>

<p>In the dim lit interior of the building, he could see gray figures of five people. He beckoned to them and they followed him down a long corridor, between rows of empty storage units, until they reached an abandoned corner office. They all gathered around a table here. There was a drafty window in this room but since it only looked out onto the back alley and the forest, they felt it was relatively secure to conduct their business transaction.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, you would not come," Ambassador Qiang was the first to speak. He was Asian, dressed in business attire and wearing a red diplomatic sash over one shoulder; he was in his 60's, with neatly combed gray hair.</p>

<p>"Since when have I ever failed to?" Ulrich responded. "Traffic is backed up near the mansion."</p>

<p>"Where is the merchandise?"</p>

<p>Ulrich glanced over at Gorgonio, who snapped his fingers at the other two. "Get them," Gorgonio ordered. Theron and Venancio slipped out into the corridor, leaving Ulrich, Qiang, his bodyguard and Gorgonio temporarily alone in the office.</p>

<p>“You look worried, governor,” observed Qiang. “I hope it is nothing that might affect my business interests.”</p>

<p>"A liability," Ulrich answered. "It seems the wildlife minister, Mr. Landon Washburn, is reluctant to sign the paperwork needed to delist the foxes."</p>

<p>"To be effective, one must learn to eliminate the problem," Qiang said.</p>

<p>The governor thought for a moment. "I believe you're right, Qiang. ...Gorgonio, you'll arrange to bring Washburn here tomorrow so I can discuss the matter with him."</p>

<p>"Done," said Gorgonio.</p>

<p>Ulrich turned his attention back to the diplomat. "And how is the market in Longguo?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Vibrant," Qiang replied. "Demand is very high among upper class..."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ulrich, "that's good to hear."</p>

<p>"Extremely," Qiang continued, "to the point that my associates in Longguo have requested a greater supply. Of course, it means higher payout for you."</p>

<p>"Consider it done," Ulrich responded.</p>

<p>At this point, the other two hunters returned with a large crate, which they placed atop the table. They proceeded to open it and then stepped back; revealing the contents to Qiang.</p>

<p>Reaching into the crate, Qiang retrieved one of the many arctic fox pelts and ran his fingers along the fur. He glanced up at Ulrich. "Excellent quality." He then lifted the suitcase he had been carrying onto the table, turned it towards Ulrich, and opened it. Inside the suitcase, neatly aligned in rows and in batches, was what appeared to be thousands of dollars in cash.</p>

<p>"Count if you like," said Qiang.</p>

<p>"No need," responded the governor, glancing up from the open suitcase, "You always come through precisely." Taking the suitcase, he smiled and shook Qiang's hand. "Ambassador Qiang, nice doing business with you."</p>

<p>"As always," Qiang replied. "But before I go..." He turned to his bodyguard and said something in a foreign language. The man, who had been carrying a brown cardboard box, handed it to Qiang who in turn handed it to Ulrich.</p>

<p>The governor, appearing a little surprised, opened it and withdrew an arctic fox stole. It was one of the full-length fur stoles with the head and tail attached. There was a clip below the jaw so that it could be fastened.</p>

<p>The ambassador said, "A token of our gratitude for your generous business with us."</p>

<p>When Ulrich nodded his head in thanks, Qiang left the room.</p>

<p>Ulrich placed the stole back in the box and glanced at the hunters, who were standing in silence. He retrieved a manila envelope from the inside of his coat and tossed it onto the table. Gorgonio snatched it and began counting the money inside. Before long, his eyes narrowed and he shoved the cash back into the envelope. "Where's our extra three percent?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You'll get it when you stop screwing up!" Ulrich retorted. "That damn ranger is still alive. If you can't handle the job, I'll get someone else; I pay for results!"</p>

<p>Venancio spoke up, "We can do it, boss. We'll try again..."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look as if you dimwits even <em>tried</em>!" Ulrich interrupted him. "The news media is saying only half the car was on fire at first and anyone in it would have had plenty of time to escape!"</p>

<p>"Is that a fact?" Gorgonio turned a suspicious, irritated gaze on Theron, who glanced down at the floor. "I'll get the ranger to have a more precise accident."</p>

<p>"Forget that for now," Ulrich answered. "We have more important matters to attend to. I want the number of pelts doubled by next week! Not to mention you have another problem to handle if you expect to redeem yourself. And you had better not mess up..." Giving them a final glare, Ulrich turned around and left.</p>

<p>Outside, padding through the territory, were Ivan and Natasha. The two foxes halted in front of the storage building.</p>

<p>"I bet we can find lots of prey here," added Ivan. "This looks like a place where rodents would..."</p>

<p>"Ivan!" Natasha said, suddenly jerking her mate underneath one of the nearby storage containers, just as three familiar people walked past...</p>

<p>"I can't believe he could have survived!" Gorgonio yelled. The foxes nearly jumped as they recognized him.</p>

<p>"It's just as well," Theron said. The foxes could pick up a sense of relief from him. "We're trappers...we're supposed to be after animals, not people."</p>

<p>Gorgonio turned around to face him. "As far as I'm concerned, there's no difference" he said, "except that there's more of a <em>thrill</em> to big game."</p>

<p>Venancio broke in. "We'll have to make sure we get the job done right, next time, or we won't get paid."</p>

<p>"We'll have to make sure <em>Theron</em> gets the job done right, next time," Gorgonio corrected, with a seething look at the younger hunter. "What's this bullshit about only half of the car being in flames?"</p>

<p>"It was a mistake! It won't happen again," Theron said.</p>

<p>Gorgonio suddenly whipped out a switchblade and held it to Theron's throat. Theron tried to back away, but he found himself pushed against the storage containers. The foxes, hidden underneath, flattened themselves even more to the ground. "Theron, I have <em>had</em> it with your hesitation! Maybe Venancio's right about you being soft. Let me just tell you that it's in your best interest to put your electrical know-how to practical use...!"</p>

<p>It was at this point the sound of snow crackling and a very faint squeak was heard. The hunters glanced down to see what appeared to be a tiny round puff of orange-brown fur beside Gorgonio, looking up at him with black eyes and twitching cream whiskers. It squeaked at him.</p>

<p>With one swift movement, keeping the knife at Theron's throat, Gorgonio kicked the little rodent so hard that it was knocked into a nearby snow bank. The pile of snow fell on top of it.</p>

<p>Gorgonio turned his harsh glare back at Theron. "Do I make myself clear, Theron?"</p>

<p>Theron found himself nearly breathless from fear, but he managed to say, "Yeah."</p>

<p>Gorgonio closed the switchblade and glanced at the snowbank where the rodent had vanished. "Fucking lemmings," he muttered as he walked off.</p>

<p>The sky had a white appearance, as if it were going to snow, and the two older hunters walked away. It was apparent that the head of the group was Gorgonio, who seemed to enjoy bullying the other two and was the meanest. Venancio seemed money hungry and Theron was the quietest, speaking only when absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"What are they doing here?" Ivan whispered, staring towards the gate. "Could they also be using this territory to cross from the forest into the city and back?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," answered Natasha, "but I don't want to stick around any longer. Come on."</p>

<p>Quickly, the two foxes fled into the woods.</p>

<p>Theron, lingering behind, did not notice the critters. He felt as if he were in a daze. It was not merely the futility of his protest; it was knowing Gorgonio was more than capable, entirely willing to carry out his threats, as if cruelty were his thrill. Theron felt sorry for the lemming Gorgonio had kicked. Trying to ignore it, he slowly walked after the other two hunters.</p>

<p>As Theron left, the lemming hopped out of the snow bank, its whiskers still twitching. Watching the hunters leave with an inscrutable gaze, it let out another squeak.</p><hr>

<p>Samantha stared out the cabin window at the falling sleet, which was gradually turning into snow. Behind her she could hear Geronimo, who was atop the table chatting about his adventures. "...we were dangling off the edge of the cliff with these <em>huge</em>, raging whirlpools in the water below, and..."</p>

<p>"You were dangling off the edge of a cliff?" Dave repeated incredulously. "Ger...we know you like to exaggerate, but come on."</p>

<p>"It's true!" Geronimo hissed. "And we were being shot at!"</p>

<p>Samantha turned around. "Shooting at you? ...how on earth did you manage to get out of that situation?"</p>

<p>"We took a gigantic leap to the nearby bridge!" Geronimo pounced off the table with a happy growl.</p>

<p>"I know what area he's talking about...the Whirlpool River. And the bridge must be the one we cross every time we're going into the city." Samantha said.</p>

<p>She glanced out the window and sitting outside were the two arctic foxes. "Our guests have arrived...be right back." Samantha got some cat food and opened the cabin door. "Hi Ivan, Hi Natasha. You like seafood, don't you?"</p>

<p>"We love it!" replied Natasha.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Ivan said.</p>

<p>Samantha placed the dishes on the porch and then turned to head into the cabin, when she stopped and looked back at the two foxes. They were watching her with big amber eyes.</p>

<p>"It's very cold out here," Samantha said at last. "Would you like to..."</p>

<p>Before she could even finish, the foxes zipped into the cabin.</p>

<p>Samantha couldn't suppress a smile as she picked up the dishes and stepped back inside. She closed the door and Geronimo said, "Ask them about it... Ivan! Natasha! Tell them about us being trapped on the edge of that cliff with those hunters shooting at us"</p>

<p>"Absolutely true." Ivan said. "We only managed to escape by leaping to a bridge that was close by."</p>

<p>"What a day!" exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>Geronimo purred.</p>

<p>"So, then, did you recognize the people that were after you?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"It's always the same three," Ivan explained. "We saw them again at the storage place we crossed through to get here."</p>

<p>"...storage place?" Samantha looked interested.</p>

<p>"A regional warehouse," said Ivan.</p>

<p>"They didn't see us, though" Natasha yapped, "but we've seen them so many times, I'd recognize them anywhere."</p>

<p>"Where is that storage place? ...I imagine it's in the warehouse district, but you wouldn't happen to have an address, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, sorry...we critters use landmarks."</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to look it up," Samantha said, taking out her notepad and pen.</p>

<p>The foxes stuck their noses into their food dishes and gobbled up the meal. It was obvious that they were very hungry.</p>

<p>"Look how starved they are," Dave remarked to Samantha on the side. "This must be the first good meal they've had in a while."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I feel sorry for them," Samantha replied. "Nevertheless, I bet they have tons of info about this poaching problem that no one else does...or that no one else wants to say."</p>

<p>"We just need to figure out, how to verify what they're telling us," Dave told the reporter.</p>

<p>"Of course Dave," Samantha replied. "But, I do feel a sense of urgency with this investigation, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason...there seems to be a missing piece to this story."</p>

<p>When the arctic foxes finished eating, they all gathered around the coffee table to talk about the day's events. Ivan and Natasha told the humans what they had heard the hunters say that evening.</p>

<p>"Did they actually <em>say</em> they were going after 'people'?" interrupted Samantha.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ivan, "What's more, they mentioned getting money, which if I understand correctly, is important in human society."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's important" Dave jumped in, "Unfortunately, some people place more importance in it than it merits."</p>

<p>Geronimo leaned against Samantha's legs and purred. She stroked the cat's head and said, "Kitty, I never doubted your story...I just thought maybe you embellished it a little."</p>

<p>"Yeah Ger," added Dave, "You've got to admit, your life has been quite exciting."</p>

<p>The cat purred even louder and squinted his eyes.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave noticed that the snow outside was beginning to come down harder and the temperature was dropping to sub-zero levels; feeling reluctant to let the two foxes out to face the arctic weather, they invited them to spend the night at the cabin, to which Ivan and Natasha readily agreed.</p>

<p>Everyone slept soundly that night. The foxes started out sleeping downstairs, until Geronimo told them about the bed upstairs, and the whole lot of critters piled onto the bed with Samantha and Dave.</p><hr>

<p>The next morning, the weather was clear. After breakfast, the two arctic foxes returned to the woods.</p>

<p>"That was the best meal I've had since last summer!" Natasha yapped as they walked back to their den.</p>

<p>"I must admit, it's hard to believe how different Geronimo's humans are from those hunters," said Ivan.</p>

<p>"There's good and bad of everything, I suppose," Natasha replied.</p>

<p>As they were emerging from the bracken, Natasha gasped suddenly. Pawsteps away was their den...encircled by the three poachers. Venancio and Theron tore through it as Gorgonio stood on the side, ordering them around.</p>

<p>The foxes backed away quietly and hid in the bushes to observe them.</p>

<p>"Tear it up, completely!" Gorgonio said. "This'll flush them into the open again."</p>

<p>Watching from behind the bushes, Natasha repeated, despondently, "Good...and bad."</p>

<p>"My God," said Ivan, "If we hadn't been at Geronimo's den last night..."</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here" Natasha interrupted; and the two scampered off into the woods.</p>

<p>Gorgonio briefly turned away from what had been the foxes' makeshift den, to notice a line of small prints in the snow. He snapped his fingers at the other two hunters, then bent down to get a closer look. He was very good at identifying pawprints; these, with their dainty, catlike trail and doglike marks, were unmistakable to a seasoned trapper. Gorgonio's eyes glittered.</p>

<p>"Arctic fox tracks."</p>

<p>He glanced up. They led halfway to the den, then turned to retreat back into the bushes.</p>

<p>Venancio peered over his shoulder and said, "We must've scared them off."</p>

<p>Ignoring the statement, Gorgonio swung his rifle over his shoulder and said, "Come on. We'll catch up to them."</p>

<p>As he and Venancio set off after the foxes, Theron was bringing up the rear. He dragged his feet through the snow, silently thinking.</p>

<p><em>Their home is destroyed again. How must they feel?</em></p>

<p>Theron was having second thoughts but shook his head and marched on; he was very deep into this and didn't know how to get out of it alive.</p><h3>Chapter 9 - Integrity and Humanity</h3>

<p>Last night's snowfall had been cleared from the roads already, so the drive into the city was swift. As the WCAT news van was crossing over the Whirlpool River bridge, the reporters chatted about their options for the day.</p>

<p>"Damn it. I miss my morning cup of coffee. If I hadn't gotten up late, I would've had time to make it." commented Samantha.</p>

<p>"That’s ok." answered Dave. "I'm sure they have coffee ready at the station. We can grab it there."</p>

<p>"Purrrrrrr..." A sound arose from the back of the van and drew closer to where the pair was.</p>

<p>Both journalists turned to see Geronimo perched in between their two seats, purring loudly.</p>

<p>"Geronimo!" Samantha exclaimed.</p>

<p>Dave had turned his attention back onto the road. "Well, we'd better figure out how to explain Geronimo's presence in the news van and hope Gao is as understanding as Ted."</p>

<p>When the journalists and their cat walked into the newsroom, they found Gao had called a meeting of the affiliate's news staff. There was someone familiar there, too...</p>

<p>"Ted!" Samantha cheerfully greeted their editor.</p>

<p>"West and Candid," Ted replied. "I was hoping you two would drop by."</p>

<p>"When did you arrive on the mainland?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"Last night. I got a call from Governor Ulrich's secretary," said Ted. "It seems the governor has something he urgently wants to discuss."</p>

<p>"Related to our investigation?" Samantha questioned.</p>

<p>"Maybe. Speaking of which, how goes the digging?"</p>

<p>"Turns out there's a poaching problem going on with the arctic foxes," explained Samantha. "We asked Ulrich what he thought about it, but all he said was that he'd order an investigation."</p>

<p>"So basically, it's just the ranger says this and the governor says that," Ted said.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. We checked fox population records to see who they'd agree with."</p>

<p>"And..."</p>

<p>"The records show that the species population is extremely low. On the verge of extinction."</p>

<p>"That sounds suspicious."</p>

<p>"Cover-up?" Samantha straightforwardly asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Have you gone back to ask Ulrich?"</p>

<p>"We did. He started out by saying that another study had been done which said the foxes had recovered, but then became evasive and threw us out of his office. It looks like the entire thing about a fox population explosion was a lie."</p>

<p>"That's what's so weird," added Dave, "Why would Ulrich go through that whole shit of even calling a conference, to announce lies?"</p>

<p>"Bribery, methinks" said Samantha.</p>

<p>"I saw your report on the car explosion," Ted acknowledged. "It looks like organized crime, but you can't prove that yet. You've got a story about Ulrich's apparent disagreement with the records, though. What's the Ministry of Wildlife say?"</p>

<p>"We've got an interview with the wildlife minister scheduled for today at 11:30," Samantha announced.</p>

<p>"Good. You need to get a statement from him on this fox thing. Also, you two are covering Ulrich's re-election campaign; if he is corrupt, it's a good excuse to keep an eye on him."</p>

<p>"Right," Samantha answered. "I'd like to get that investigative report about the foxes on the News at Noon."</p>

<p>"Only if you can get a statement from the wildlife minister by then," cautioned Ted.</p>

<p>"Until the interview, both of you should brush up on the governor's campaign," Gao added. "There's footage in our archives about both candidates that should bring you up-to-date on Nortenya politics."</p>

<p>"Who's on the follow-up to the car explosion?" Dave asked.</p>

<p>"We are," chimed in another reporter, gesturing to herself and a photographer.</p>

<p>A whirring noise suddenly ended with the whack of a paw against paper, and they all looked to see Geronimo, his back arched, hissing at a fax machine.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, stop notarizing those press releases!" Samantha exclaimed. She gave a quick glance to Gao and a small smile. "We can explain," she said.</p>

<p>"You don't have to," Gao brushed it off. "Ted has told me anecdotes about our unofficial mascot."</p>

<p>The meeting ended, Samantha went over to Geronimo and retrieved the paper from the fax machine. It had five small rips where Geronimo's claws had punctured the paper.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you Ger...I get frustrated with all that PR shit too," Dave spoke up.</p>

<p>Todd, one of the other reporters, looked at it over Samantha's shoulder. "Hey, this might make a good feature story, though. Maybe I can convince Gao to let me cover it for the broadcast, if you guys aren't interested."</p>

<p>Samantha handed him the press release, and as he walked to the adjacent desk, Samantha remarked, "We've got a lot on our plate with the arctic fox story. What are you covering today?"</p>

<p>"Some theft of chloroform from the Vaharis hospital... I wonder what they're naming the baby panda," he added off-topic, still reading through the press release.</p>

<p>Samantha could not contain her surprise. "Chloroform? Why would anyone want that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but a source of mine at the police station says in the wrong hands that stuff can be dangerous," said Todd. "What I find more interesting is the fact that someone can just walk into a hospital and make off with a controlled substance, and apparently not even get caught on camera."</p>

<p>"What's chloroform?" Geronimo mewed.</p>

<p>"A general anesthetic," answered Samantha. "It makes you pass out if you breathe it."</p>

<p>"Sounds like you've got a mini expose," Dave said happily.</p>

<p>Todd filed the press release away and began typing out a preliminary report at his desk. "They're all going to point fingers and blame each other."</p>

<p>"They always do," Samantha replied.</p>

<p>The reporter and her cameraman walked over to the coffee machine, followed by Geronimo. "Can I have coffee?" he purred.</p>

<p>"No, you're a kitty," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"Humans hog all the good food," Geronimo hissed. "No coffee, no chocolate...only canned and dry kibble for us critters."</p>

<p>"If it was up to you, you'd have a mocha drink," Samantha replied, pouring out the coffee into one of the mugs with the station's logo. "Leandra says this stuff isn't healthy for cats."</p>

<p>"Excuses," Geronimo flattened his ears.</p>

<p>Dave was watching the television next to the coffee machine. It was set to one of their competitors, Channel 13, and their morning news program. However, they were currently on a commercial break; one of Ulrich's political advertisements came on the screen. It was criticizing his opponent in the election, and extolling what Ulrich promised to do if re-elected.</p>

<p>"When's the election?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"In two months," replied Samantha.</p>

<p>The advertisement ended with the governor's campaign slogan: <em>"Re-Elect Governor Ulrich! Integrity and Humanity!"</em></p><hr>

<p>Landon Washburn arrived at his office around 9 in the morning and spent about an hour or so there before leaving for the TV interview. From his office at the Ministry of Wildlife's headquarters in Sarrilla's national capital, it would be at least a one hour drive to arrive at Vaharis.</p>

<p>On the way out, he told his secretary, "I'm leaving for the day. Take all my messages...oh and by the way, if you like, you can leave at 3."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you sir," she replied.</p>

<p>When he exited the building, the air outside was freezing cold and sparse snowflakes carried on the wind. He walked to his car and as he was fumbling around with the keys, a hand came up from behind with a handkerchief and covered his nose and mouth. As Washburn reached up, another hand emerged and grabbed him by the neck. He struggled but felt himself getting weaker and weaker as the sweet scent of chloroform took effect. It took only a moment for Washburn to pass out.</p><hr>

<p>Meanwhile, back in Vaharis, Ted drove up the driveway at the governor's mansion. A security guard met him as he got out of the car and Ted showed him his press ID. "I have an appointment with Governor Ulrich."</p>

<p>"That's fine, sir." said the guard, "Right through those doors, straight down the hall you'll find elevators. Go up to the second floor."</p>

<p>Ted took the elevator up and walked down the hall to an entryway. There was a secretary here, seated at a desk.</p>

<p>As the lady looked up at him, Ted introduced himself. "Oh, yes, Mr. Hughes" the lady replied, "The Governor has been waiting for you. Just one moment and I'll let him know you're here."</p>

<p>Having said that, she got up and walked through a doorway that was behind her.</p>

<p>About five minutes passed and she returned. "You may go in now, sir" she said smiling.</p>

<p>Ted crossed a small foyer and saw another door that was ajar. "Come in," a voice said.</p>

<p>As Ted walked in, he saw Ulrich seated at a desk. "Have a seat." he said to Ted. "Thank you for coming, Mr. Hughes."</p>

<p>Ted sat down. "Yes, well, I sensed some urgency on your part, governor."</p>

<p>"I'll get straight to the point." Ulrich said. "I presume that you are the top news editor at WCAT Channel 8?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am in charge."</p>

<p>"...and Miss Samantha West is one of your employees?"</p>

<p>"She is."</p>

<p>"How long have you employed her?"</p>

<p>Ted gave him an annoyed look. "What did she do?"</p>

<p>"She tried to pressure me to answer questions and when I refused to answer, she turned my statements out of context to make it seem as if I was a liar! Then, when I told her and the photographer to leave, she argued they had a right to stay; with the camera rolling no less!"</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"I've told you plenty!"</p>

<p>"Governor Ulrich," said Ted, "all you've said just confirms what I've always said about Samantha West...she's an excellent reporter, devoted to her work..."</p>

<p>"If you're condoning this kind of sensational, ratings-hungry journalism, Mr. Hughes, I'd remind you that I have the option to sue your station in court if that film is aired."</p>

<p>"True...you do have that option, however, as a public figure you would never win. Why don't you want the film aired?" Ted asked, taking out a notepad.</p>

<p>"I didn't call you here for an interview, Mr. Hughes."</p>

<p>"What did you want to say?"</p>

<p>"No comment," Ulrich said. "The door's behind you. Leave."</p>

<p>"Gladly," responded Ted as he got up and left the office. "There was no need for me to travel such a long distance."</p>

<p>Ulrich didn't answer. He was shuffling through several papers that were in front of him.</p>

<p>Ted was so angry, that he didn't notice Mabel passing by. He bumped into her.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, madam...I was in a hurry," Ted said.</p>

<p>"That's quite all right, it has happened to me too," Mabel smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I was on my way out. I guess I'm having a busy day," Ted continued.</p>

<p>"Well, if you just met with the Governor, then I'm not surprised that you feel tense," answered Mabel.</p>

<p>"Oh? Do you work for the governor?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>Mabel had a surprised look on her face when she realized that he had not recognized her. She smiled and said, "Actually...I'm his wife."</p>

<p>Ted looked at her for a while, not knowing what to say. "I work for WCAT News; I'm the editor on Tropical Island. He said he wanted to speak with me, but as it turns out it was just a complaint."</p>

<p>"Victor does that sometimes. He forgets that people have other things to do." Mabel countered.</p>

<p>"I apologize, Mrs. Ulrich... I didn't want to upset you."</p>

<p>"Oh no...it's ok."</p>

<p>They shook hands and Mabel turned to go up the stairs. "Have a good day," she said.</p>

<p>"You too," answered Ted.</p>

<p>As Ted walked down the hallway and to the elevators, he thought about Mabel and mumbled to himself, "What a remarkable looking woman. It's hard to believe that such a gentle soul is married to such an arrogant man like Victor Ulrich."</p><hr>

<p>The office of the regional treasurer was on the same floor as that of the governor. Denise Ralston crossed with Ted as she was exiting the elevator, and she walked over to her office. She got a call a while later from Ulrich's secretary.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ms. Ralston?"</p>

<p>"Yes? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Governor Ulrich would like to see you in his office at your earliest convenience."</p>

<p>"I take that to mean today?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's his preference."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll be there within an hour."</p>

<p>"Thank you Ms. Ralston; I'll let him know."</p>

<p>Denise hung up without any further conversation. "Fuck," she muttered, "and I was hoping for a short work day. What could he possibly want?"</p>

<p>Forty-five minutes passed and Denise headed towards Ulrich's office.</p>

<p>When she walked through the door, Ulrich was standing behind his desk with a large gift box wrapped in plain brown paper, and fiddling a cigarette between his fingers.</p>

<p>"I think you might like this," he said, handing her the box and sitting down.</p>

<p>Denise grabbed the box and without hesitation, tore off the brown paper and opened it.</p>

<p>"Why Victor, it's <em>stunning</em>!" Denise Ralston swung the arctic fox stole about her neck. "And arctic fox! Won't the other women at the country club be so envious..."</p>

<p>"You can't tell anyone it's real arctic fox fur," Governor Ulrich reminded her.</p>

<p>Denise gave him a quick, almost affronted, glare. "Victor, you really don't think I would wear anything <em>but</em> real furs, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, say it's dyed red fox, but don't let anyone know it's arctic." Ulrich insisted. "Remember, we haven't gotten those animals off the endangered species list yet."</p>

<p>"We're going to," Denise said, "All right then...dyed red fox."</p>

<p>The phone on Ulrich's desk rang and he answered it. "Ulrich speaking."</p>

<p>Gorgonio was on the other line. "It's done."</p>

<p>"I'll be there right away," Ulrich replied, putting out his cigarette in the ashtray.</p>

<p>He hung up the phone, grabbed his coat from the coat rack and headed towards the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Denise in surprise.</p>

<p>"I'll be back later, I've got things to do," he answered, and left.</p><hr>

<p>To Roxanne, the entire city of Vaharis was her territory. A domain so vast, of course, could not be patrolled in one day - and especially not now in the wintertime, when the weather could be both fickle and unrelenting - so she did so in parts, varying her distance and pace according to her own and the climate's whims.</p>

<p>It happened that today she was prowling around the warehouse district, a section of the city that not only had plenty of hiding-places for cats but was also prey-rich. She was stalking a mouse when a car pulled up. This scared the rodent off; Roxanne hissed and looked up to see who had spoiled her hunt.</p>

<p>She saw two men who she recognized to be Gorgonio and Venancio half-carrying another man towards a warehouse; but she was really interested when she saw Governor Ulrich arrive in his car.</p>

<p>The cat crouched down flat, but Ulrich had not noticed her. He got out of the car and went into the building.</p>

<p>Roxanne padded across the alley from the forest and stopped at the 'No Trespassing' sign. It was the regional warehouse. Roxanne knew this place - she knew the history and inside layouts of most of the region's property. The warehouse had been left to fall into disrepair, yet officially was still in use. She could only surmise what Ulrich could be doing here. Roxanne crawled underneath one of the holly bushes near the door and pawed at the snow here until she found an opening that led into the building. She snuck in.</p>

<p>She emerged into one of the abandoned storage units and observed Ulrich walk by, crossing with Venancio who was leaving. Neither one said anything, and no one saw Roxanne.</p>

<p>The cat followed Ulrich at a distance. They walked down the grey, dungeon-like corridors until he turned and entered one of the storage units here. Roxanne paused for a moment, but decided to creep forward and see what was going on.</p>

<p>Her eyes glowed in the darkness, and she saw the man Gorgonio and Venancio had brought seated in a chair here. Gorgonio stood beside the chair.</p>

<p>Washburn began to stir, and Ulrich reached up, turning on a lightbulb that hung from the ceiling. The blinding glare made the wildlife minister flinch and shut his eyes again, but his eyesight began to focus slowly and he began assimilating his surroundings. The sight of Gorgonio and Ulrich, coupled with the shadowy, windowless room he was in, made a sudden terror come over him.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Nowhere you can ever be found," responded the governor. "You're here because you've been reluctant to sign these documents," he added, laying the falsified fox population documents on the table before Washburn.</p>

<p>"What you're asking me to do is illegal," Washburn protested. "The foxes can't be delisted. They'd never survive."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Mr. Washburn," Ulrich said coldly, with a gesture to Gorgonio who proceeded to pull out a revolver, "the foxes <em>will</em> be delisted, with your signature, or else you die."</p>

<p>Roxanne, watching from out in the hallway, flattened her ears as Gorgonio held the gun to Washburn's head; the wildlife minister began pleading.</p>

<p>"No, Ulrich, please! I'll do whatever you say!"</p>

<p>"Sign the documents, Washburn."</p>

<p>Washburn took the pen, but then hesitated fearfully. "...Then, you'll let me go?"</p>

<p>"I give you my word that I won't kill you," Ulrich promised, his voice impassive.</p>

<p>Washburn proceeded to sign the fraudulent documents. He had to steady his hands from shaking. Once he had done so, he handed the paperwork back to Ulrich.</p>

<p>"With this the arctic fox can be delisted?" Ulrich prompted.</p>

<p>"Yes," Washburn answered. His voice sounded defeated. "One copy must be filed at the Capitol records office."</p>

<p>Ulrich looked up and with a sharp nod towards Washburn, said to the hunter, "Kill him."</p>

<p>Ulrich turned to leave, and an astonished, horrified Washburn sprang up, only to be pushed back down into his seat by Gorgonio. "But you said...!"</p>

<p>The Nortenya governor glanced back at him and evenly replied:</p>

<p>"I said <em>I</em> wouldn't kill you."</p>

<p>Washburn was stunned, and just stared at him.</p>

<p>Ulrich nodded a farewell. "Goodbye, Mr. Washburn," he said, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>"Ulrich, don't do this to me!" the wildlife minister implored.</p>

<p>Roxanne was about to back away when Ulrich came into the corridor. He gave her a mildly curious look and said:</p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed before, but if we dyed your fur white it could pass for fox."</p>

<p>A gunshot made Roxanne jump. Washburn had fallen silent.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll ever understand human cruelty," she hissed at Ulrich. "You slaughter your own kind."</p>

<p>"You're just a dumb animal," he responded, and walked away. Roxanne, casting one final glance into the storage unit, followed Governor Ulrich outside to his car.</p><h3>Chapter 10 - A Question Mark</h3>

<p>Samantha and Dave arrived at the restaurant where Washburn was supposed to meet them. When they opened the back door of the news van to get their equipment, out jumped a happy Geronimo, tail held high.</p>

<p>"Geronimo!" they both shouted.</p>

<p>"<em>Meowrr</em>, that's me! <em>Prrrrrrrr...</em>" purred the cat.</p>

<p>"How in the world were you able to get in here?" Dave said, surprised. "I barely turned my back when I loaded the cameras."</p>

<p>"It's a cat thing," answered Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, try to stay out of trouble...we're in a rush, so we'll meet you here after the interview," said Samantha as she walked away with Dave following close behind.</p>

<p>The Chinese restaurant was one of the upscale establishments on Vaharis' luxurious Brook Avenue, situated alongside elegant casinos and department stores that Samantha could easily imagine might be behind a black-market trade in fox furs. Inside, the journalists were led to their table - they had called to reserve one beforehand - Dave placed the camera on the extra chair and they sat to wait for their interviewee.</p>

<p>The interior of the restaurant was decorated in red and gold, with delicately painted drawings of flowers and legendary Asian animals on the walls. After some time had passed without Washburn arriving, Samantha and Dave decided to go ahead and order their meal. The waiter bowed and left.</p>

<p>"Well, if we have to look at the bright side of this, it has been a while since our last dinner outing," reasoned Samantha.</p>

<p>"That's true," agreed Dave. "We've been so busy lately. Still, I wonder what could be keeping Washburn." He thought for a moment, and then added, "You don't think he went to the competing stations, do you?"</p>

<p>"Damn, I bet Channel 13 is scooping us on this fox thing," Samantha said.</p>

<p>There was a crashing sound from the kitchen, and moments later the cook appeared at the kitchen entrance quarreling with the manager in Chinese. Samantha and Dave both observed the spat from their table; the language, spoken swiftly and fluently, was melodious but nonetheless incomprehensible to Dave. "Sam, you speak Chinese, don't you? What's going on?"</p>

<p>"The rice pot fell on the floor," Samantha easily translated, "and the manager is telling the cook not to be so clumsy; the rice costs money. The cook says he's overworked and the manager is answering that if he doesn't do his job right he'll fire him. The cook says the manager will never find anyone who can cook Asian food better in Nortenya."</p>

<p>Dave seemed pensive but said nothing. He drank a sip of water from one of the goblets, then gave Samantha a questioning look. "How many languages <em>do</em> you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, several," she brushed it off indifferently.</p>

<p>The waiter arrived shortly with the main course - General Tso's Chicken - but minus the rice. "Very sorry, the rice will take a bit longer," he told them.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Samantha.</p>

<p>As soon as the waiter left, Samantha and Dave began eating.</p>

<p>Samantha picked up the chopsticks with a smile on her face. "Hey!" she exclaimed. "Chopsticks! It's been a while that I tried these. ...Dave, you're going to use a fork?"</p>

<p>"Yep, I'm sticking with the tried-and-true...besides, last time I tried chopsticks I could barely pick up anything," replied Dave. He lifted a goblet of water and said, "A toast to my Samantha, the most beautiful, intrepid reporter in Sarrilla. I pledge my eternal love to you."</p>

<p>Samantha grasped her goblet, clicked it with his, and replied, "And to my Dave, I pledge my love to you and I am forever yours."</p>

<p>They continued eating and eventually the waiter brought the rice. A few minutes later, Dave noticed several men enter the restaurant. One of the men seemed strangely familiar.</p>

<p>"What is it, Dave?" asked Samantha, looking in the direction that Dave was.</p>

<p>Dave looked back down at his plate. "One of those guys looks like someone we've seen before, somewhere."</p>

<p>Samantha looked back to Dave, "We've gone so many places and talked to so many people..."</p>

<p>"I know where..." interrupted Dave pensively. "He appears in the background of the closing shot we took outside of the wildlife convention...he was talking to Ulrich."</p>

<p>"Well, well..." said Samantha, "The story seems to be getting better and better."</p>

<p>They finished their meal, paid the bill, and left to head back to the news studio. Washburn had never shown up for the scheduled interview, but now the reporters were intrigued by the person they had seen in the restaurant; and they were determined to find out who he was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Geronimo had wandered down the block to a nearby public park. The long stretch of grassland, which was presently snow-covered, was situated near an icy stream that gradually cascaded into the gorge.</p>

<p>The lynx-point tomcat was padding around the park when he heard bushes rustling, and he crouched down. As he listened to the sound, however, he realized that the rustling was not the typical sort that came from prey scurrying about; it was more frantic in nature.</p>

<p>He crept towards the holly bush where it came from and found a small, orange-furred critter clutching a piece of chopped celery. The celery piece was nearly the same size as the pudgy little rodent.</p>

<p>Geronimo watched the critter in bewilderment. The rodent was stuck between two branches and unwilling to drop the celery. It had been struggling to get free, but upon seeing the feline it froze.</p>

<p>On a whim, the cat leaned forward to bite at the branches; the rodent began struggling again until Geronimo hissed, "I'm trying to get you loose! You need to drop the plant."</p>

<p>The rodent gave a muffled squeak; nevertheless, it released its hold on the celery, which allowed Geronimo to gnaw at the branches until it was free.</p>

<p>Now loose, the critter gave another squeak, picked up its piece of celery and ran off without saying anything more. As Geronimo watched it vanish under the roots of a pine tree, he was still utterly perplexed.</p>

<p>A yap cut through his thoughts. "You let food get away!"</p>

<p>Geronimo turned to see Ivan and Natasha standing nearby, their eyes wide.</p>

<p>"I wasn't hungry," Geronimo explained. "Besides, that looks like some kind of hamster. It might be a lost pet."</p>

<p>"That's a lemming," said Natasha.</p>

<p>"<em>That's</em> a lemming?" Geronimo was surprised. "They don't look so vicious."</p>

<p>"They're vicious," Ivan replied simply.</p>

<p>"It's a tiny fluff ball. Imagine that little thing attacking deer. The way you two were talking about them, you'd think they were animals thrice our size." He changed the topic, "What brings you into the city?"</p>

<p>"The hunters," Natasha answered. "They destroyed our den."</p>

<p>"Again?" meowed Geronimo.</p>

<p>Natasha nodded.</p>

<p>Ivan growled, "Survival has become a struggle for us."</p>

<p>"Geronimo!" The cat pricked up his ears when he heard Samantha calling him, and he hurried over with his tail waving; the foxes followed him.</p>

<p>He found his humans at the news van, packing up their camera equipment.</p>

<p>"Come on Ger, we're heading back to the newsroom," said Dave.</p>

<p>"What did the wildlife minister say in the interview?" Geronimo asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"He never showed up. It's odd," Samantha answered. "He seemed to want to talk with the press..." She glanced over at the foxes. "Natasha, Ivan, how are things in the forest?"</p>

<p>Geronimo leapt into her arms before the foxes could reply. "The damn poachers destroyed their den again," he said.</p>

<p>"When?" asked Samantha, with an inquisitive look at the foxes.</p>

<p>"This morning," Natasha explained. "We were going back to our den and found the hunters there. They must have spied us, because the next thing we knew we were on the run again. We managed to lose them at a riverbank."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they come live with us at the cabin?" Geronimo mewed.</p>

<p>"Well..." Samantha hesitated. She and Dave looked at each other, and then at the critters. All three animals were giving them a wide-eyed look. The reporter smiled. "All right, as long as we're in Nortenya."</p>

<p>Geronimo purred and rubbed his head against her face. "See, didn't I tell you they were good humans?" he told the foxes.</p>

<p>The three critters piled into the back of the news van, and as Samantha and Dave got into the vehicle they all peeked out happily. "This has got to count as some kind of conflict of interest," Samantha remarked to Dave, "We're taking care of two critters involved in a plight we're covering."</p>

<p>Dave shrugged. "What else can we do? Besides, the hunting is illegal; there's not much that can be disputed about that."</p>

<p>"That's true, and it's also true that in many respects they've been acting as sources. I guess we should find some way to help them," Samantha considered.</p>

<p>The critters were ambivalent to their dilemma. "Let's put music!" purred Geronimo, pawing at the car radio.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Ivan.</p>

<p>"A radio," said Geronimo. "It's like a TV without pictures."</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," yapped Natasha.</p>

<p>"We're going to the office; there's food there," said Dave.</p><hr>

<p>Governor Ulrich had arrived back at the governor's mansion. Roxanne had returned in the car with him, sitting in the passenger seat, to the governor's vocal chagrin.</p>

<p>"You worthless animal." Ulrich's scorn was undisguised. He parked the car, and as he opened the door and stepped outside with Roxanne hopping out after him, he continued uncaringly: "If this wasn't an election year I might just tell Gorgonio to do away with you. You're not even a purebred animal. The only reason I tolerate you is for my public image."</p>

<p>"Not even for Mabel?" questioned Roxanne.</p>

<p>"You know fully well I only married Mabel for her inheritance," the governor dismissed her.</p>

<p>"Is that why you spend nights away with Denise?" Roxanne growled.</p>

<p>"None of your fucking business," he replied.</p>

<p>He walked off quickly and the cat sat in the pathway, watching as he stepped into the building. <em>Mabel shouldn't be with him, </em>thought the cat, <em>that poor human of mine seems to be stuck and she's so kind to me. I should do something to help her. </em>An idea crossed her mind, and she began to purr.</p>

<p><em>There must be a reason why Denise never wants anyone to go into her office, </em>she thought.</p>

<p>Roxanne went inside the mansion and went up to the regional offices. She found Denise's office and strolled in.</p>

<p>Denise’s office was past her secretary’s desk, and down a corridor. It was neat, though not as expansive as the governor’s, with a window behind the desk and bookshelves full of financial reports to the left of the doorway. Denise was not here.</p>

<p>Roxanne caught sight of something white and fluffy draped over the back of the treasurer's office chair and she hopped up on the desk to inspect it.</p>

<p>It looked like a fox, but it was limp. Roxanne extended a paw and poked it. She sprang back, her back arched, as it fell onto the chair in a heap.</p>

<p>It was still motionless, and she sniffed it carefully, finally jumping on the chair next to it. Confirming that it was a fox skin and not a live animal, she grabbed it and hopped down from the chair. "Just wait until Mabel sees this," the cat mewed, her voice muffled through the plush fox fur.</p>

<p>As Roxanne padded out of the office, the fox stole dragging behind her, Denise was coming up the hallway. She saw the cat.</p>

<p>"Why you, thief!" Denise exclaimed.</p>

<p>Roxanne flattened her ears and ran off, still carrying the fur. Denise chased her and turning the corner, nearly collided with none other than Mabel.</p>

<p>Roxanne, still not letting go of the fox stole, spun around and hissed.</p>

<p>"Roxanne...What do you have there, dear?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>Before the cat had a chance to answer, Denise spoke up. "Your little <em>dear</em> took my fur stole. I wonder how many more things she's taken."</p>

<p>"My cat never steals...unlike some humans," said Mabel, taking it from her cat. As she handed it over to Denise, she noticed it was real fur. Fox fur. Denise practically snatched it from her and replied, "What's that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>"If the shoe fits, wear it," answered Mabel.</p>

<p>Denise felt enraged but said nothing as she left curtly with the fox stole. <em>Who cares what she thinks, </em>she thought. <em>She hasn't got any power to do anything.</em></p>

<p>When Denise had gone, Mabel addressed the cat. "Okay, what's going on, Roxanne? Why were you carrying around that fur stole?"</p>

<p>"That's just it, madam. <em>Fox</em>. Now that the governor is so hell-bent on delisting them, that bitch starts wearing fox fur? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...Victor has been cheating on you with Denise. I bet he gave her that piece of fur. Damn them both," concluded the cat.</p>

<p>Mabel sighed. "I've known about the affair for quite a while and I've been thinking about my options. I can either divorce him or not, and if I do, should I do so before or after the elections? But...this thing with the fur is strange, and knowing Victor, I wouldn't be surprised if he's doing something illegal."</p>

<p>"All the more reason to get out of this marriage, the sooner the better," meowed Roxanne.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mabel, "Try to stay out of her way. Come on, let's go have a snack."</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a few minutes," answered the cat.</p>

<p>"Ok," replied Mabel. She wondered why the cat wasn't eager to go after a meal, but she didn't worry. "Don't take too long," she smiled at the cat, and the cat purred.</p><hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Denise had returned to her office and no sooner had she gone in, than Ulrich appeared at the doorway.</p>

<p>"You're back soon," she mentioned.</p>

<p>“I’m coming to get those reports that I asked you for three days ago,” replied Ulrich.</p>

<p>Denise gathered some papers and held them out to him. Ulrich walked through the doors, took hold of the papers and turned to leave.</p>

<p>“You certainly are rushed,” remarked Denise. “I wondered where you had gone to earlier. You didn’t have anything listed in your planned schedule.”</p>

<p>"I had someone eliminated. One less problem to worry about," he said.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Washburn. He was the wildlife minister."</p>

<p>Denise took out a cigarette from a small wooden box on her desk and lit it. She took a puff and said, "Let's see how long before it gets on the news."</p>

<p>Ulrich took the cigarette from her lips, took a long drag on it, and returned it to her.</p>

<p>"I have paperwork to finish," he said plainly, and walked out of the office.</p><h3>Chapter 11 - Discovery</h3>

<p>Samantha and Dave walked into the newsroom with the cat and the two foxes parading proudly behind them. This elicited no reaction from their editor, Ted. He was used to the unpredictable, especially from these two.</p>

<p>"First Geronimo and now two arctic foxes?" Ted wryly said.</p>

<p>"Ted, there's an explanation..." Samantha began.</p>

<p>Ted didn't let her finish. "Good work, both of you. An interview with two of the poaching victims will make for an interesting segment." He gestured to the foxes. "How did you find them?"</p>

<p>"I met them in the woods," Geronimo piped up.</p>

<p>Samantha felt slightly embarrassed that she hadn't thought of interviewing them for the broadcast. "In full disclosure, their den was destroyed and they're going to be living with us at the lodge."</p>

<p>"That's fine; they're critters," said Ted. "How'd the interview go?"</p>

<p>"Washburn didn't come," Samantha responded.</p>

<p>"We saw someone there who looked familiar, though," Dave added. "We're going to look through the archives and see what we can dig up on him."</p>

<p>"While you're at it, look for verifiable and still-newsworthy dirt on Ulrich," Ted told them. "The son of a bitch called me all the way over from Tropical Island to complain about your news coverage."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave left Ivan and Natasha in the newsroom, where the foxes were being petted and fed by their colleagues, and went in search of the tape. Geronimo tagged after them.</p>

<p>They found it swiftly and went to the viewing room to play the tape back. They paused the film at Samantha's sign-off and, zooming in on the monitor, were able to clearly see Governor Ulrich speaking with the man they had seen at the restaurant.</p>

<p>"I wonder who he is and what they were discussing," Samantha said.</p>

<p>"That sash he's wearing looks official," Dave considered.</p>

<p>The mainland editor, Devon Gao, came over to them and handed them a paper. "Press release from the governor's campaign office; it's his speaking schedule."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Samantha, and then asked, "By the way, were trying to figure out who this guy is. Would you know?"</p>

<p>"That's the ambassador of Longguo, Qiang Xue" Gao answered, and hurried on his way.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave stared at the screen, neither one saying anything, until at last Geronimo broke the silence.</p>

<p>"So what? He's a foreign official; aren't they sometimes guests at these types of conferences?"</p>

<p>"That's the thing - he wasn't <em>at</em> the conference" Dave answered.</p>

<p>Samantha, her green eyes locked on the screen, whispered:</p>

<p>"Dave, this is bigger than we ever could have imagined."</p>

<p>They walked back to the desk, still astounded. "It's <em>international</em> news," Dave stated.</p>

<p>"The fact the diplomat was speaking to Ulrich outside, where supposedly no one would notice, instead of coming into the convention center means something." Samantha sat down at the desk. "If we can just prove the connection between Ambassador Qiang and Governor Ulrich..."</p>

<p>"You might even win an award!" Geronimo purred. "What's that journalism award they give out called?"</p>

<p>"The Ribbon of Truth," Samantha replied, "and the point of investigating isn't to win awards. The point is to let the truth be known."</p>

<p>"But if you can get a ribbon even better," Geronimo squinted.</p>

<p>"You just want a ribbon," smiled Samantha.</p>

<p>"A ball of yarn would be great too," added the cat.</p>

<p>The phone rang just then and Samantha answered it. "WCAT news office. Samantha West speaking."</p>

<p>"Hello, Ms. West?" A female voice came on the other line. "You're investigating the arctic fox poaching, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Samantha motioned to Dave, who asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>She did not answer him, but continued with the telephone call.</p>

<p>"Yes...do you know any information about it?"</p>

<p>"I know enough," the lady replied.</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Ms. West," said the lady, "I could give you the year's biggest expose and start an international incident."</p>

<p>By now, Dave had moved to Samantha's side and was listening right along with her at the telephone receiver. He could barely believe what he was hearing. Samantha was more motivated than ever to get to the bottom of things. "An international incident with who?"</p>

<p>When the other line remained silent, Samantha asked, "Longguo?"</p>

<p>"That's right," the lady spoke up. "I'm glad to see the free press doing its job well."</p>

<p>"We try. Are the furs being shipped abroad?"</p>

<p>The lady hesitated. "I want to tell you everything...but I don't know if I should."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I...won't tell you over the phone. I'll meet you at the Black Fox Casino, at 2 in the morning."</p>

<p>Samantha was jotting this down in her notepad. "2 in the morning? That's rather early."</p>

<p>"I'm usually out at that time. I'll be near the roulette wheel."</p>

<p>"How will I recognize you?"</p>

<p>"I will say a password...it will be 'Some warm milk on a chilly night like this might be good.'"</p>

<p>"All right. Who am I speaking with, please?"</p>

<p>"A concerned citizen. I work in the governor's mansion."</p>

<p>"Are you worried about losing your job?"</p>

<p>"I'm worried about losing my lives," said the lady, and she hung up.</p>

<p>"<em>'Lives'</em>?" Samantha wondered aloud as the foxes came scampering over.</p>

<p>Samantha had an idea. "Ivan, Natasha, do you think you could show us the warehouse where you saw the poachers last night?"</p>

<p>"Well..." Ivan hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll only take a minute," insisted Samantha. "I want to see if there's anything there that might give us more info."</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Who knows! That's exactly why we should go over and investigate," Samantha declared, her green eyes shining. "Why were the poachers there? What were they doing...?"</p>

<p>"...and who else was involved?" added Dave with a smile.</p>

<p>The foxes sighed. "Geronimo, why did you teach your humans how to give a critter look?" Ivan complained.</p>

<p>"Not my fault! They picked it up themselves," explained the tomcat.</p>

<p>Ted was heading out his office door when his two top reporters caught up with him.</p>

<p>"Ted," said Samantha, "Dave and I are going to see this warehouse building where the poachers were spotted."</p>

<p>"That's fine," replied the editor, "You've got my number if something comes up."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave got into the news van with the critters and drove off.</p><hr>

<p>Park Ranger Jovan Conway was in the city, shopping for a few items. He felt hungry and noticed a cafeteria, so he headed towards it. As he approached the cafe, he noticed a lady coming from the opposite way. She looked familiar and as she got closer Conway recognized her. She was Mabel, the governor's wife, who he had met earlier. Mabel recognized him too, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Fancy meeting you again," she said.</p>

<p>"Just getting something to eat," answered Conway, letting a smile cross his face. <em>She </em><strong><em><span class="s8">is</span></em></strong><em> a beautiful woman, </em>he thought, opening the door for her as they arrived to the front of the restaurant.</p>

<p>Once inside, the place was crowded. This was a small, cozy place that had been in business for many years and had a reputation for good food.</p>

<p>Mabel heard a meow and looked down. It was Roxanne, her cat.</p>

<p>"Roxanne! I was wondering where you were," she exclaimed, picking her up.</p>

<p>"You have an elegant cat, Mrs. Ulrich," said Conway. "She's really beautiful."</p>

<p>Roxanne purred. She liked him. <em>He would be purrrrfect for my human, </em>she thought.</p>

<p>"Please, call me Mabel," she said. The cat purred louder.</p>

<p>"Only if you call me Jovan," he replied and smiled.</p>

<p>They looked around the place and all seats were occupied, except for one table in the far corner. It was far from the big windows that faced the street but it had sufficient lighting and seemed comfortable. "There's a spot," pointed the cat with her tail.</p>

<p>The cat leapt out of Mabel's arms and ran to it, lying across the top of the table. "Rrrreserved," she growled at anyone who dared approach.</p>

<p>Conway and Mabel placed their food orders at the counter, paid and went over to the table. Roxanne the cat happily jumped down to one of the seats to allow them to place the food on the table. The cat gave Mabel an especially intense look that prompted the lady to say, "Yes kitty, I got you a fish sandwich, minus the condiments."</p>

<p>The cat got immediately to eating, while the pair talked and ate.</p>

<p>Conway and Mabel found that they really got along well, and had a lot in common. They both liked the same music, they both enjoyed taking nature walks, and they were both lonely at times. Mabel confided in Conway that she was considering getting a divorce from the governor, and that, if so, it would most likely be finalized after the election.</p>

<p>An hour went by and the two got up to leave. "I hope I will see you again," said Conway.</p>

<p>"Me too," answered Mabel.</p>

<p>As they left the cafeteria, Conway turning towards the east and Mabel towards the west, they were both thinking about how special the other was, and wondering if destiny had any plans in common for them.</p><hr>

<p>The regional storage facility was a long drive from the TV station. The warehouse district was on the opposite side of the city.</p>

<p>Geronimo, perched on Samantha's lap and watching the outside through the window, silently figured the travel time for a cat by paw to be a few hours. Ivan directed Dave as he drove into the blighted territory, with its shabby factories and abandoned storage buildings. Even in the afternoon, the place was still desolate.</p>

<p>"You turn down this lane here, past the bridge," explained Ivan, gesturing with a paw to the highway that towered above the side of the street. The cars could be heard overhead, but underneath the grey pillars, a long patch of asphalt was shielded from the snow. "The building should be all the way at the end of it."</p>

<p>"Watt Street," observed Dave.</p>

<p>Samantha suddenly noticed something lying motionless under the bridge. "...Dave!"</p>

<p>Her photographer looked over and stopped the news van. The three critters gave perplexed mews and yaps as the reporter and her cameraman jumped out of the car. Dave grabbed his camera and ran after Samantha who by now had reached the man lying on the ground.</p>

<p>Samantha looked at him with surprise. "Mr. Washburn!"</p>

<p>"He looks like he still might be breathing," said Dave.</p><hr>

<p>The police and an ambulance arrived swiftly and as they placed Washburn on a gurney for transport to the hospital, police officers questioned the two journalists. Samantha and Dave decided to follow the ambulance to the hospital, but first they dropped off the critters in front of the TV station.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, you know what floor the newsroom is on," Samantha told the tomcat. "You three go there. We'll be back as soon as we're done with our report."</p>

<p>"Ok," meowed Geronimo.</p>

<p>Samantha had called their editor shortly after finding Washburn and at the WCAT television station their colleagues ran to get the information on the air; before long the competing stations picked up on it. Breaking news bulletins pre-empted the shows that were typically playing at this time, and reporters in the nation's capital were waiting for a statement from the Sarrillian prime minister, James Tresser.</p>

<p>Mr. Landon Washburn, as the Minister of Wildlife, was on the same level as the ministers in charge of defense, commerce, and so forth; in his position, appointed by the prime minister, he oversaw all of Sarrilla's wildlife and natural resources, hence his being found severely injured was the lead story in newspapers and newscasts everywhere in the nation.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave were the first journalists at the hospital, so they got the best location to park the news van and set up their camera equipment. Ted arrived soon after, as they were waiting for their cue.</p>

<p>"Hi Ted," said Samantha, waving at him.</p>

<p>"West, Candid, you two go ahead with the broadcast," Ted quickly directed. "I'm going inside to keep an eye on what's happening with Washburn. I'll come over if there are any new developments."</p>

<p>Watching them from his car was the police chief, Carson Meadows, who had taken a lunch break. The media frenzy had not yet arrived, besides Samantha and Dave, and they were too immersed in their live report to notice him at the moment.</p>

<p>When his cell phone rang, he checked the caller ID before answering it. It was Governor Ulrich.</p>

<p>"Meadows, it's Ulrich. I saw the news on Washburn."</p>

<p>"Yeah," answered the police chief, "It's terrible, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Do you know where the two journalists who found Washburn are?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I can see them standing over there. I think they're televising right now."</p>

<p>"Chief Meadows, I want that television reporter and her cameraman arrested on charges of attempting to murder the wildlife minister. When he dies, charge them with murder."</p>

<p>"The <em>TV reporters</em>?" Meadows was flabbergasted. "Those charges will never stick on them. It's ludicrous."</p>

<p>"They were going to interview him, weren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>"They met him, only instead of interviewing him they shot him. She wanted a story that would make her famous, so she concocted this cruel scheme and her photographer went along with her. Work with it."</p>

<p>"I thought I would just proceed with the usual investigation."</p>

<p>"Not this one."</p>

<p>There was uneasy silence. Ulrich spoke again, "You will get your set price."</p>

<p>"Done." answered Meadows, and hung up.</p>

<p>Samantha had finished the initial half of her report and was standing in front of the camera, watching the footage she and Dave had taped and edited earlier play on the monitor screen.</p>

<p>"I hope Washburn will be ok," Dave said.</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed Samantha. "I wouldn't be a bit surprised if this has to do with the arctic fox poaching. He did say he had info about the foxes."</p>

<p>Samantha pressed her hand against the earpiece as the police chief came over.</p>

<p>"You two are under arrest for the attempted murder of Mr. Landon Washburn," Meadows announced.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave both appeared confused, and Samantha briefly glanced at the camera before she asked, "<em>What</em>? What evidence do you have?"</p>

<p>"If you don't shut up, I'll have you incarcerated for disrespecting authority as well!" he snapped.</p>

<p>Still appearing confused, Samantha removed the earpiece and handed the microphone to Dave, only to have Meadows seize her with handcuffs.</p>

<p>"I'm coming along. Is this necessary?" she evenly asked.</p>

<p>"I told you to shut up and do as I say," he retorted and looked over at Dave. The photographer was still standing behind the TV camera, which he had turned to point at them. Meadows pulled him away from the camera and put handcuffs on him as well, before happening to glance down at the monitor. It displayed the image of the three of them; Meadows and the captive Samantha and Dave. He glanced from the monitor to the camera and then at the journalists.</p>

<p>"Why are we on there?" was the only thing Meadows could say.</p>

<p>"Because you're arresting us in the middle of a live broadcast," Samantha answered, holding herself back from adding, <em>stupid.</em></p>

<p>Over at the governor's mansion, Ulrich covered his face with a hand disapprovingly. He was watching the news on channel 8.</p>

<p>"First Gorgonio can't kill him and now Meadows can't arrest these people without publicizing it," the governor muttered. "Why am I surrounded by morons?"</p><h3>Chapter 12 - Jailed Journalists</h3>

<p>The sight of the TV reporter and her cameraman being dragged into the police station was enough to make everyone in the hectic place do a double-take. The secretary was particularly astonished. "Isn't that Samantha West, from TV?"</p>

<p>Someone there who was also arrested gave a wolf-whistle and shouted, "Extra, extra!" but when Samantha whipped around with a glare the room hushed.</p>

<p>"Don't we get a phone call?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"This is an outrage," Samantha said. "It's an infringement on our rights as press under the Sarrillian constitution..."</p>

<p>"Tell it to your lawyer because not even the judge'll care," Meadows responded and ushered them to one of the holding cells.</p>

<p>"When do we get our lawyer?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"We didn't hurt Washburn," insisted Samantha. "We never even got to meet with him! Who told you to arrest us? It's because of our investigative reporting, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You journalists always want to think it's retaliation, don't you? You think too highly of yourselves," Meadows snapped.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to remove the handcuffs?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"When you're taken out to be photographed and fingerprinted," Meadows answered, pushing them into the cage and adding smugly, "There's an hour-long backlog."</p>

<p>"Our television station is going to have a <em>field day</em> with you!" Samantha hissed.</p>

<p>"Don't think your being a celebrity is going to save you from the firing squad if Washburn dies," Meadows scoffed and walked away.</p>

<p>"'Celebrity'?!" Samantha exclaimed. "The nerve, as if I were a commercial spokeswoman or something!"</p>

<p>"Chill, Sam," Dave tried to soothe.</p>

<p>"I have a headache," Samantha said, sitting down on the bench.</p>

<p>As Chief Meadows was walking away, Detective Hartcourt came walking in. He took one look at the jailed journalists and turned disbelievingly to the police chief. "Those people are press," he told him.</p>

<p>"What of it?" asked Meadows.</p>

<p>"What in the world did they do?" Hartcourt inquired.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" Meadows defiantly responded.</p>

<p>"You're going to have members of the media everywhere in here once they hear their colleagues are jailed," Hartcourt pointed out. "They're going to be saying the Vaharis police force is like the Longguo state police."</p>

<p>"I'm the police chief," Meadows said, "not you."</p>

<p>Hartcourt didn't respond, but when Meadows walked off the detective told Samantha, "Please don't villify the whole department. There are a lot of honest, decent police officers working here."</p>

<p>"Is Chief Meadows neither honest nor decent?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"Off the record?" asked Hartcourt in a whisper.</p>

<p>Before anyone could say anything more, Ted walked in.</p>

<p>"Ted!" Dave said.</p>

<p>"One of our producers called me, and said you two had been arrested on the air," Ted said. "I had to see it for myself, because I couldn't believe that the Vaharis Police Department would be so stupid."</p>

<p>"Who might you be?" Meadows snapped.</p>

<p>"Ted Hughes, the managing editor of WCAT-TV," Ted replied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hughes, your employees are facing some serious charges," Meadows said.</p>

<p>"Please tell me <em>why</em> West and Candid would try to kill the Minister of Wildlife," the news editor demanded.</p>

<p>"Simple," Meadows glared at the TV news crew. "She wanted a story so big it would give her national fame, perhaps even make her anchorwoman, so they lured him to an interview meeting only to kill him."</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous!" Samantha exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Starting with the fact she turned down the anchor position some time ago," Dave added with clear annoyance towards the police chief.</p>

<p>"Your charges are baseless, and Washburn's not dead, he's alive and awake," Ted said. "I just came from the hospital. He woke up and told all the reporters and doctors standing around that he never met with Samantha and Dave. In fact, he gave a description of the person who shot him."</p>

<p>"He woke up?" Meadows replied incredulously. "Last I heard, doctors weren't even sure if he was going to make it!"</p>

<p>"If you don't believe me, turn on the TV," Ted answered. "All the networks have it on film; in the meantime remove those handcuffs and release my employees or face a lawsuit."</p>

<p>Reluctantly, and with visible disdain, the police chief unlocked the cell door and motioned for the journalists to get out. He then proceeded to remove the handcuffs. This accomplished, Meadows stepped aside.</p>

<p>"When will you be speaking to Washburn?" Samantha asked, retrieving her notepad.</p>

<p>"You can wait for the official statement later today," Meadows responded curtly.</p>

<p>"I hate covering PR releases," Samantha remarked to Dave, "They always leave out the information they'd rather not see on the air."</p>

<p>"You people always put more than you ought to on the air," answered Meadows angrily.</p>

<p>"West, Candid!" Ted called sternly. The reporter and cameraman duo hurried after their editor.</p>

<p>Once they were outside, Ted turned to the pair and said, "You two should go back to the hospital and talk to Washburn, regardless of the fact that our competitors got a head start in airing a report. I don't know whose bright idea it was to jail you two as if Sarrilla were some kind of dictatorship; but we can't let that succeed in censoring our newscast."</p>

<p>Samantha nodded. "Ok Ted, we'll talk to you later."</p><hr>

<p>Samantha and Dave arrived fairly quickly at the hospital and went straight to Washburn's room, where they found him awake. He greeted them first.</p>

<p>"I have to thank you, both of you. I owe you my life," said Washburn, weakly. "I also wanted to apologize."</p>

<p>"Apologize?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"For missing our first interview meeting," he explained, "and for requesting that you not air this one."</p>

<p>"We won't air it," she told him. "But why?"</p>

<p>"I didn't tell the police or the other members of the press what actually happened," he said. "I was ambushed in the Wildlife Ministry parking lot by the person I described to them, and he put a handkerchief over my nose and mouth...after that I passed out...I'm guessing it must have been chloroform; I remember hearing in the news that someone had stolen some from the hospital. That much was true. When I woke up, I was inside what looked like a warehouse...I was sitting in a chair, in front of a table...and standing there was the man from the parking lot, and Governor Ulrich."</p>

<p>"<em>Governor Victor Ulrich</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Washburn replied. "Two or three weeks ago, he contacted me and said he wanted to delist the arctic fox. He offered me half a million dollars if I would replace the population records on file with ones saying that the arctic fox was making a come-back and the Wildlife Ministry was authorizing its delisting."</p>

<p>"Did he say why he wanted them off the endangered species list?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't...and for half a million dollars I wasn't about to ask. But I wasn't sure about doing it...I spent all that time before the wildlife conference mulling over it...and I finally decided it wasn't worth it. I couldn't do it. Those animals can't survive off the endangered species list, at least not yet, in their current state...and I was afraid what would happen if I went along with the corruption and people found out."</p>

<p>"So you never switched the documents," Samantha said.</p>

<p>"When Ulrich found out, he called me and demanded to know why. I told him I didn't want to do it and he responded that I had 48 hours to sign the papers."</p>

<p>"When was this?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday...so when I woke up at the warehouse, I must admit, I was afraid for my life."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"The governor put the fraudulent paperwork in front of me...the other man with him held a revolver to my head...and Ulrich told me to sign the documents or else I would die."</p>

<p>Washburn fell silent, and Samantha didn't say anything; he continued eventually, almost pleadingly:</p>

<p>"What could I have done? I signed the documents. I was terrified. I begged him not to shoot me. Ulrich said he wouldn't kill me if I signed the papers...and when I did, then he turned around and ordered the other man to do away with me anyway. He said he had told me the truth...<em>he</em> wasn't going to kill me."</p>

<p>He shuddered. "The next thing I remember was waking up here in the hospital. They told me you two were both incarcerated on suspicion of having shot me. Ulrich was probably behind that as well. He likely learned somehow that you were investigating this fox matter...and planned to frame you two for killing me. I imagine he'd have to bribe someone else though...I can't imagine what judge and jury in their right minds would believe a television news crew plotted such a crime."</p>

<p>"He knew what we were up to," Samantha acknowledged. "We went to confront him about the discrepancy in the records, and why he was saying he could delist the foxes when the records said another thing. We just never got to air the report because there was a car explosion in front of the governor's mansion..." Samantha's voice trailed off.</p>

<p><em>If Ulrich tried to kill the wildlife minister...then he could have been behind Ranger Conway's car exploding, too...and if all this is true, the Nortenya region has a gangster in its highest government office, </em>she thought.</p>

<p>"You see why I don't want this reported," Washburn said. "I'm concerned that Ulrich may try again to do something to me, or my wife."</p>

<p>"But then the documents on file are false," Samantha pointed out.</p>

<p>"They'll stay there," Washburn answered, "and Ulrich will succeed in delisting the arctic fox. I can't do any more. I'm sorry for those animals, they've done nothing to deserve being wiped out as a species...but it's my own life, and the lives of my family at stake."</p>

<p>"Will you tell the prime minister?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, pensively. "I don't think anyone else would believe me." He studied the pair and then said, "What are you planning to do now?"</p>

<p>"We're going to continue investigating and bring out the truth about the arctic foxes," declared Samantha.</p>

<p>"Don't do it," Washburn told her. "If Ulrich doesn't mind trying to murder one of the men in the prime minister's cabinet, he won't stop at journalists. I don't want to be partly responsible for you two getting killed."</p>

<p>"Thank you for taking the time to speak with us, Mr. Washburn," answered Samantha. "We hope you feel better." Then, Samantha and Dave walked out of the room, into the hallway.</p>

<p>Samantha turned to Dave and said, "I'm going after this story, regardless of the risk."</p>

<p>"<em>We</em> are going after this story," her cameraman replied.</p><h3>Chapter 13 - The Anonymous Source</h3>

<p>That night, the reporter and her cameraman arrived at the casino. They left Geronimo and the two arctic foxes at the cabin, took a taxi part of the way, then walked a block or so to the Black Fox Casino on Brook Avenue in their elegant evening attire. They had hurriedly bought the outfits for the casino meeting. Samantha was wearing an evergreen silk dress that had sequins about the collar, and a mink fur stole; while Dave wore a tuxedo. The wind was sharp and the two journalists were freezing by the time they arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>They approached the roulette table and found many people standing around it as the present game ended, as well as the croupier - the man directing the game - but there was one creature there who stood out: the beautiful longhaired tuxedo cat with the amethyst-studded collar who was sitting regally beside the roulette wheel.</p>

<p>"<em>Faites vos jeux</em>," the man said, and players began to place their bets.</p>

<p>Samantha placed some casino chips on the square for 8 and she and Dave looked around, trying to figure out who the caller was.</p>

<p>"Some warm milk on a chilly night like this might be good," a voice purred.</p>

<p>Samantha glanced down to see the cat, who had wandered over to where she was standing. Trying to use discretion, they all watched the roulette wheel spin. "You were at the wildlife convention," said the reporter. "The governor's cat, Roxanne?"</p>

<p>"That's me-ow," replied Roxanne.</p>

<p>"What do you know?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm not even sure I should have called you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The corruption is pervasive...and the only thing that seems to determine whether one's the hunter or the prey anymore is lacking."</p>

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p>"Luck," replied Roxanne, leaping off the roulette table and scampering off. Samantha turned but before she could say a word, the croupier announced:</p>

<p>"Eight. The lady wins."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave cashed in the casino chips and looked for Roxanne. They found her sitting on a table in the nightclub dining area. A band here was playing music, while some people were dancing.</p>

<p>Samantha sat at the table, taking out her notepad. "I remember you said on the telephone that you work in the governor's mansion," she smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm their resident mouse-catcher." Roxanne flattened her ears. "I changed my mind about talking to the press."</p>

<p>"Roxanne, you're one of our only leads on this story," Samantha confided. "We'll never get to the bottom of this without someone willing to talk."</p>

<p>"It's not worth my pelt," hissed Roxanne.</p>

<p>"You're worried about retaliation?" Samantha asked. "Surely the governor wouldn't harm his own pet?"</p>

<p>"The idea that I'm the family housecat was conjured up for the voters," Roxanne told her dryly. "Mabel's really my human, and Victor is my human only by association."</p>

<p>"Even so, would he really hurt you if Mabel cares about you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Roxanne stated bluntly.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave glanced at each other; when her cameraman shrugged, Samantha turned back to Roxanne. "We'll keep your name secret. We won't say you told us the information."</p>

<p>"Do you really understand what you're promising?" Roxanne meowed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"How do I know you'll keep your promise?"</p>

<p>"You have our word as journalists."</p>

<p>"That's noble but impractical," the cat replied with a wave of her tail.</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"Victor Ulrich can make anyone do what he wants." Roxanne answered.</p>

<p>There was a pause, with only the music from the band in the air; finally, Samantha spoke:</p>

<p>"I will never reveal your identity, no matter what."</p>

<p>"That counts for both of us," interjected Dave.</p>

<p>Roxanne flexed her claws thoughtfully. Just then, a meow chimed in.</p>

<p>"Geronimo?" Samantha said.</p>

<p>"We came in a taxi!" Dave was surprised. "How...?"</p>

<p>"If a kitty can sneak into a news van, a kitty can sneak into a taxi," Geronimo said matter-of-factly. "Come on, you don't think I would miss out on a real conversation with an anonymous source?!" he purred, swishing his tail.</p>

<p>"Are these your humans?" Roxanne asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Yep. My name's Geronimo. My humans take this 'protect your source' matter very seriously," Geronimo meowed. "It's one of their sacred ethics things. If they promise to keep your name secret, they will."</p>

<p>Roxanne studied Geronimo, then turned back to the two journalists who were waiting with a tacit expectation. "The poaching ring is being run out of the governor's mansion," Roxanne began directly. "It's really only a small group of people involved, but they have half the region terrified of them, or else bribed into complacency. Those people are Governor Victor Ulrich, and his treasurer-slash-mistress Denise Ralston." Roxanne ended this statement with a short hiss.</p>

<p>"How does the whole racket work?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"It's fairly simple. The Longguo ambassador was the one who started it," Roxanne growled.</p>

<p>"Qiang Xue?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He approached Victor one day with a business proposition. He had heard Victor was party to this sort of stuff and naturally Victor was very interested in any new and profitable enterprise, no matter how illegal or unethical. At Victor's order, the poachers hunt arctic foxes and turn the pelts over to him; Victor sells the furs to the ambassador. Denise takes money out of the regional treasury and gives it to Victor; he uses the money to pay the poachers. Denise gets kickbacks from Victor's selling the furs."</p>

<p>"How much is Ulrich getting for the furs?"</p>

<p>"1 million Sarrillian dollars from each sale," replied Roxanne.</p>

<p>At that moment, a waiter walked over. "Are you ready to order?"</p>

<p>Samantha, immersed in the interview, had half-forgotten that they were in a dining area. She glanced quickly at the menu, then looked over at their source.</p>

<p>"Lobster, please," Roxanne purred.</p>

<p>"A whole lobster or just the meat?" asked the waiter.</p>

<p>"Meat, please, thank you," responded Samantha.</p>

<p>When the waiter left with the order, Samantha asked the cat:</p>

<p>"How many pelts are usually sold at once?"</p>

<p>"About 100 furs, from what I've heard. It used to be 50, but Qiang wanted the number doubled on account of how lucrative the market is. At that rate you can imagine how quickly the species will be decimated."</p>

<p>"What does Ambassador Qiang want with fox pelts?"</p>

<p>"What I've heard is that the dictator in Longguo is the owner of a syndicate that has a large stake in the fur trade. Qiang gives him the furs, and his corporation makes fur garments and things which are sold domestically...arctic fox fur is some kind of a status symbol there, and having a fox coat is apparently highly coveted among the wealthy."</p>

<p>"It was the same in Sarrilla once," said Samantha, "until the foxes were hunted to near-extinction. ...Who are the poachers?"</p>

<p>"Their names are Seth Gorgonio, Luke Theron, and Virgil Venancio," Roxanne declared. "Gorgonio is the leader of the poachers; he tends to have frequent chats with Victor over the telephone. I saw them once at the governor's mansion, complaining to Denise that they hadn't been paid the previous week and I saw Victor hand them an envelope and throw them out of the office. He told them they should never go there again and should only meet at the appointed place."</p>

<p>"...the appointed place?"</p>

<p>"Where the fur exchange happens. It's always held at the same place."</p>

<p>"Where <em>do</em> the fur sales take place?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know," said Roxanne. "All I know is that they're typically held Fridays at night."</p>

<p>"Is that when the poachers are usually paid?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Does Denise go to the meetings at all?"</p>

<p>"Never. She just withdraws the cash and Victor goes wherever-it-is for the actual transaction."</p>

<p>"How does she write off their payment?"</p>

<p>"She does fraud on the books. How exactly, I'm not sure, but she makes it look legal enough so that the auditors overlook it."</p>

<p>"Maybe the payroll?"</p>

<p>"Could be." Roxanne was still unsure.</p>

<p>Samantha looked down at her notepad momentarily. She had been taking thorough notes throughout the interview, and the page was already half-covered in abbreviated scribbles of black ink.</p>

<p>"There's one more thing I noticed," added the cat. "One of the men, the younger one they call Theron...he didn't seem too happy to be in the company of the others. I sensed he felt trapped and wishing for a way out. He is a kind-hearted human, actually. I met him once."</p>

<p>It was at this point that the waiter arrived with the food. Roxanne and Geronimo pawed at Samantha and Dave for lobster, which they readily provided. As they ate, Roxanne continued speaking, recounting to the journalists the tale of political conspiracy and corruption.</p>

<p>"Victor got the bright idea to delist the foxes. He figured it would make his image look good in an election year; he'd be able to say that the arctic fox recovered under his administration. Whether it's true or not is besides the point, of course. With the foxes delisted, they can hunt more in the open," meowed Roxanne. "Anyway, he made a deal with the Minister of Wildlife, Mr. Washburn, to falsify documents and make them say the foxes could be taken off the endangered species list, but Washburn had a change of heart. Victor was furious when you two arrived at his office with the legit documents. He told Washburn over the phone he had 48 hours to sign the paperwork, and Washburn still refused to. So Victor ordered Gorgonio and Venancio to kidnap Washburn. They held him at gunpoint and forced him to sign the documents. Then they shot him. Gorgonio actually did, on Victor's orders." Roxanne appeared disgusted with the thought. "When you two found the wildlife minister, Victor called Chief Carson Meadows and told him to charge you with attempted murder. The police chief is one of the people Victor pays on occasion to do small jobs, mostly overlooking things Victor and his cronies do."</p>

<p>"That verifies Washburn's story," Dave said to Samantha.</p>

<p>"You're right...although..." Samantha turned back to the cat, who was licking her fur. "How do you know this?"</p>

<p>"I was at the warehouse when it happened." Roxanne answered.</p>

<p>"Which warehouse?"</p>

<p>"It's a regional warehouse on the outskirts of the city. I don't know the exact street address, but it's on Watt Street," said Roxanne, lifting a paw and inspecting her sharp claws. "It's a brick building, looks half-abandoned..."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave looked triumphantly at each other with the same thought; it was Geronimo who stated it. "It's probably the same warehouse where the foxes saw the damn poachers!"</p>

<p>"What foxes?" asked Roxanne.</p>

<p>"Two arctic foxes," Geronimo purred. "They're my friends. My humans are letting them stay at our den temporarily because of the poachers."</p>

<p>Roxanne was interested. "I was right to call you," she purred, "People who care that much for a critter's plight are trustworthy."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering if that warehouse is where they're storing the furs," Samantha considered. "It would explain why the foxes saw the hunters there."</p>

<p>"It might be," Roxanne seemed thoughtful, "but again I don't know. They could just be storing them where they live."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"Land tract A-4," purred Roxanne.</p>

<p>This elicited a questioning look from Samantha. "A-4?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How do you know it's tract A-4?"</p>

<p>"I overheard Victor discussing it with Gorgonio over the telephone when they were first starting the poaching scheme," said Roxanne. "Apparently the place is situated on the tundra, away from most streets, and has an old hunting lodge there from before the foxes were classified as endangered. That area of Hammond Forest is the perfect, isolated place for them to prepare pelts and store their illegal traps--"</p>

<p>"Who gave them the traps?" Samantha interjected.</p>

<p>"Qiang did," answered Roxanne. "Speaking of illegal stuff, Denise has this fur stole which I'm sure Victor gave her. It's a complete fox, with white fur."</p>

<p>"Could it be a red fox pelt?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I've seen a few other humans wearing such things at fancy events I've attended. This is fluffier than the ones I've seen before."</p>

<p>Samantha reviewed her notes. "What part of the warehouse did you say Washburn was shot in...?"</p>

<p>"One of the storage units," Roxanne explained. "The only thing in that entire building are abandoned storage units; except for an office room, with a window overlooking the back alley. That's abandoned too."</p>

<p>Samantha scribbled the description down in her notepad. Roxanne stood up and stretched, arching her back. "Well, I've got to return to the mansion," said the longhaired cat. "My human, Mabel, will be wondering where I am."</p>

<p>"If we want to contact you for any more questions, how should we go about doing so?" Samantha asked.</p>

<p>"I can go find her!" Geronimo piped up. "<em>Purrrr</em>-lease? No one would expect a kitty!"</p>

<p>"That makes sense," Roxanne agreed. "If you want to meet with me, send Geronimo to the governor's mansion by noon." Roxanne turned to Geronimo and said, "There's a big tree that grows on the side of the mansion. It reaches all the way up to the top windows. I'll pass by around noon and if I see you on sitting one of the branches, I'll take that to mean your humans want to meet with me." Turning back to Samantha and Dave, she added, "If I want to meet with you, I'll call your office like I did this time."</p>

<p>"All right," said Samantha. "I'm curious...How <em>did</em> you call us?"</p>

<p>Roxanne purred. "I push the receiver off, and hook one claw onto the dial in order to call zero. Then I let the operator connect me to the channel 8 newsroom."</p>

<p>"Clever!" meowed Geronimo. "I should've thought of that!"</p>

<p>"Ok, here's my last question," Samantha told her. "What prompted you to come forward?"</p>

<p>"If I said it was purely for the sake of my fellow critters, I wouldn't be very honest," Roxanne admitted. "Really I was getting irritated by Victor because he's cheating on Mabel with that bitch Denise. Also, when Victor saw me at the warehouse he threatened to dye my fur white," she added with a growl.</p>

<p>"Dye your fur white?" Samantha asked, perplexed.</p>

<p>"He said it would make it look more like fox fur," Roxanne hissed.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave were speechless; Geronimo looked horrified. Roxanne lashed her tail. "Victor isn't the paragon of 'Integrity and Humanity' everyone believes he is," said Roxanne.</p>

<p>She leapt down from the table, and as she was padding away Samantha said, "Thank you for the interview, Roxanne."</p>

<p>"Don't forget to keep my identity a secret," the cat replied before scampering off.</p><h3>Chapter 14 - Arctic Tundra</h3>

<p>The early-morning winter sky was still dark when Samantha and Dave - along with Geronimo - caught a taxi from the casino and headed directly to the TV station. Once there, Samantha went to her desk and within five minutes had typed up a report based on the information from Roxanne.</p>

<p>"I'll go get Ted," said Dave, and hurried off to find their editor.</p>

<p>Geronimo was analyzing the computer screen. Below the script, which was divided neatly into two halves - the left with video notations, the right with Samantha's report - was a number 30 bordered by two dashes. "Why do you always put a number thirty at the end of your scripts?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a journalist thing," Samantha answered. "It means it's the end of your story."</p>

<p>"Why not just put 'The End'?"</p>

<p>"A very long time ago," she explained, "during wartime, a newspaper reporter was using telegraph to report on the war. He uncovered an important story and managed to get the news out, but they shot him at his post. He used to sign off at the end of his messages with the number thirty...so, ever since then, reporters put a thirty at the end of their reports."</p>

<p>Geronimo was silent. This statement, and the information Roxanne had given them about the extent of the corruption, somehow made the tomcat realize that this was not as much of a carefree game as he had imagined. "This job does have a history of danger, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Before Samantha could answer, Dave returned with their editor following. "What's this I hear about you two having the expose of the year?" Ted asked.</p>

<p>"Just that," said Samantha, pulling the paper from the printer as it emerged and handing it to Ted.</p>

<p>Ted took it and, in turn, handed her a manila envelope. "...This came from the governor's office, to your attention."</p>

<p>Samantha opened the envelope. Inside was a copy of Washburn's signed 'correction', and a cover letter, printed on the Nortenya region's official stationary, which read:</p>

<p><i>Miss Samantha West,</i></p>

<p><i>I come to you by way of these lines to address the issue of whether the arctic fox can be removed from the endangered species list.</i></p>

<p><i>Pursuant to our interview, I took the liberty of inquiring at the Capitol records office and found that a correction to the arctic fox population document was issued by the Ministry of Wildlife two months ago, but mistakenly was never filed by the clerk.</i></p>

<p><i>I have enclosed a photocopy of the aforementioned document in the hopes of clearing up any misunderstanding that may have occurred.</i></p>

<p><i>Sincerely,<br />
Governor Victor Ulrich</i></p>

<p>Ted was reading through the news story, and only stopped to glance up at Samantha and Dave once he had finished. Both the reporter and her cameraman were studying the letter; Samantha was sitting down and Dave stood behind her. Geronimo had leapt onto Samantha's lap. They glanced up at their editor's expectant gaze.</p>

<p>"This anonymous source close to the governor's mansion..." Ted said finally, "how reliable is he?"</p>

<p>"We haven't checked it out yet," said Samantha, "but we think we were told the truth."</p>

<p>"Just thinking you have the truth isn't good enough," Ted said. "This person is saying the governor is party to attempted murder and national treason. You've got to have something to back it up. Especially now in an election year. Is there any chance this source is making this up just to lower Ulrich's ratings in the polls?"</p>

<p>Samantha considered Roxanne's admission that Ulrich had been cheating on Mabel, and wondered briefly if that might have made Roxanne exaggerate things even slightly. The sparrows on Tropical Island, Samantha knew, were famed for doing this when used as sources. She recalled one instance, shortly after a hurricane, when they flew to them claiming missiles were falling on the far side of the island. Samantha and Dave went to investigate and found it was only a tree that had fallen after being weakened by the storm. The story of birds now having to find another tree for their nests had made for an interesting human interest report, but it was certainly not war breaking out and definitely not the lead in their broadcast.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Samantha at last admitted.</p>

<p>Ted looked over the report once again. "This says the governor is corrupt, the treasurer is corrupt, and the ambassador of Longguo is doing something that would destroy all diplomatic ties with Sarrilla. If this <em>is</em> true, it's a damn good story." He handed the report back to Samantha with a smile.</p>

<p>"Verify it."</p>

<p>Samantha couldn't help but smile back.</p><hr>

<p>The next few weeks were hectic for Samantha and Dave. Samantha researched Roxanne's tips and called up various people she thought might provide more information. Most of the people she called would fearfully hang up the phone as soon as she identified herself, or else they would yell at her and say, "No comment." The only film clip they had where the governor and the ambassador appeared together was the one in front of the wildlife convention, and it didn't prove anything.</p>

<p>In between, the TV news crew would go to the Capitol records office and search for any compromising documents. They would spend lengthy hours sifting through file cabinets that turned up nothing, scanning rows and rows of large numbers in microfilmed payrolls to no avail. A few times they brought stacks of documents they copied back to the newsroom to look through. Once, Geronimo unintentionally leapt up onto the table where the documents were neatly placed, scattering them on the floor and causing the journalists to spend another hour or so, putting the papers back in order.</p>

<p>All through this, Samantha and Dave had the election to cover. They would go out and do interviews for the election stories, giving live reports on whatever developments arose in the campaigns. Ulrich's opponent in the election was the Vaharis mayor Egan Irving, who accused Ulrich of mismanaging regional funds and being in the employ of special interests. This could be said to be the truth but he had no way to prove it, and Ulrich scoffed back that his opponent wanted to raise taxes and stifle corporate growth. Ulrich also took every opportunity to extol how his administration had succeeding in bringing arctic foxes back from the brink of extinction. No one spoke anymore about the arctic fox population discrepancy. Washburn remained silent, as he had said he would. Conway had not spoken since the incident at the governor's mansion, preceding the car explosion. Week after week elapsed to become a month, and despite the determined efforts of the reporter and her cameraman, all the tips from their anonymous source seemed to be unprovable.</p>

<p>So, that cold Friday at noon, Samantha stood in front of the governor's mansion before the camera, signing off her report:</p>

<p>"...Controversy or not, tomorrow night Governor Ulrich will sign the papers to officially delist the arctic fox. It'll go into effect a week from now - the day after the election. Reporting Live, Samantha West, WCAT 8 News."</p>

<p>Roxanne the cat was watching from a window in the governor's mansion, and she glanced up as Governor Ulrich appeared behind her, holding a cigarette up to his lips. The governor gazed outside at the news van, with its thin, tall antenna raised into the air and the two journalists broadcasting beneath it. He took a puff from the cigarette and stepped away from the window indifferently just as Denise burst into the office, wearing the fox stole slung over one shoulder.</p>

<p>"Victor this is unbelievable," she declared. "Those TV news people have been going through tons of documents at the records office. If they keep up like this, sooner or later they'll find something..."</p>

<p>"Denise, you're paranoid," Ulrich brushed aside her concerns. "These reporters relish a game of cat and mouse, something that they can pull out and pretend that they're looking out for their audience, holding people accountable, and all of that pretentious shit. That's why that TV reporter Samantha West has stayed with this so long. TV is a very fickle business, however. She won't have the time to stay chasing this mouse for very long."</p>

<p>"Suppose she gets the time?"</p>

<p>"No doubt she has her price," Ulrich said dismissively, "and curiosity does have a way with cats."</p>

<p>From the window, Roxanne hissed at him.</p>

<p>Outside, with the news report finished, Dave began dismantling the camera equipment. "Looks like our investigation deadline is election night, if we're hoping to prevent the foxes from going extinct," Dave said.</p>

<p>"Hopefully we can uncover what's going on sooner," Samantha answered. "I can't believe it! All those leads we've been following, and we still can't confirm the info!"</p>

<p>"Where's Geronimo?" asked Dave suddenly.</p>

<p>A meow from above made both the reporter and her cameraman look at the top of the news van. The cat was perched here, staring up delightedly at the microwave antenna.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, get down from there!" said Samantha.</p>

<p>"It's awesome the size of this antenna!" Geronimo purred. "It's like a huge tree!"</p>

<p>"We're going to lower it, Ger," said Dave. "Come down here."</p>

<p>Geronimo leapt off the news van. "How does that antenna work?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it transmits our signal out," Samantha explained briefly, and changing the subject said to Dave, "You know, we should drop by the ranger station. I have a few questions I'd like to ask Ranger Conway."</p>

<p>"Yeah, he hasn't spoken since the car explosion," Dave remarked.</p>

<p>Geronimo was bouncing around. "How do you make the antenna big and then little again? I want to see!"</p>

<p>"Ger..." Dave started, but Geronimo was so excited and purring loudly that the two journalists relented. "Ok. Over here," Dave explained, showing Geronimo a switch in the back of the news van with the broadcasting equipment, "is the lever which raises the antenna mast. When it's up, then air can go into the antenna tower and raise it."</p>

<p>"Yay!" Geronimo purred.</p>

<p>"But you shouldn't poke at this, Geronimo," Samantha cautioned. "The antenna should only be up when we're going to broadcast. It puts the news van in lock, meaning you can't drive with the antenna up."</p>

<p>"Also, you have to make sure there aren't any power lines overhead before you raise the antenna," Dave added. "If the antenna gets tangled in power lines and you touch the van, you won't be reporting the news, you'll <em>be</em> the news."</p>

<p>"That's where we have the saying, 'Look up and Live,'" Samantha informed the cat. "It's happened to other reporters before."</p>

<p>"Hiss," a wide-eyed Geronimo said. "You don't just have dangerous stories you cover, you have dangerous equipment."</p>

<p>"As long as we're careful setting up for broadcast, we don't have anything to worry about from that," Samantha told him more cheerfully. She looked at Dave and said, "Let's get over to the ranger station and see if Conway is there."</p>

<p>Geronimo was talkative throughout the drive out of the city. "You know what that reminds me of? That helicopter crash you were in that happened the day I was born."</p>

<p>"That's different," Samantha said. "The pilot didn't do anything wrong. The rotor on the tail just malfunctioned."</p>

<p>"Spinning...!" Geronimo mewed, chasing his tail in the back of the news van.</p>

<p>"There was nothing fun about it," Dave pointed out. "It was dizzying."</p>

<p>"...and painful," Samantha added, seeming to wince at the memory. "We all ended up in the hospital. My leg was dislocated at the hip."</p>

<p>"Why do TV news stations have choppers?" Geronimo asked, hopping in between the driver and passenger seats.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you can spot something newsworthy from the sky," Dave explained. "You can get some great camera angles from up there."</p>

<p>"Also, it means you don't have to rely on police traffic cameras for aerial shots and traffic info," Samantha continued. "It shows viewers that we're going out and digging stuff up ourselves, verifying what we're told instead of just blindly broadcasting it."</p>

<p>"I'd like to ride in a helicopter, one day," purred the cat.</p>

<p>A light diamond-dust of snow was drifting down when they reached the ranger station. It was a cabin with a wood sign that identified it as the Hammond Forest ranger station, with a clearing in front that had space for about three or four cars to park. Ranger Conway was the only park ranger staffing this northernmost outpost, and the cabin doubled as his living quarters.</p>

<p>"Hi, Ranger Conway!" Samantha happily greeted him.</p>

<p>"Samantha, Dave." Conway did not look surprised to see them; he seemed rather indifferent, as if he had expected the pair to show up sooner or later. "Why don't you come in? I'll get you some hot chocolate," he said, although rather half-heartedly.</p>

<p>The interior of the ranger station had a fireplace and a sofa, where the journalists sat. Geronimo jumped onto the wood coffee table. Zachary, the Husky, came over with his tail wagging. "The news-people! ...and a kittycat!"</p>

<p>"Hello Zachary," smiled Samantha, petting him on the head.</p>

<p>Conway came over with the hot chocolate. "I imagine you're wondering why it's been a month, and I've stopped talking about the foxes," he said directly.</p>

<p>"Why did you?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"The car explosion was bad enough," explained Conway, "but shortly after that I got a phone call threatening to harm Zach if I continued to protest the arctic fox's delisting." The park ranger was blunt. "They said if they could shoot a little fox, then it would be an easy matter to shoot a big dog...and then afterward it would be me."</p>

<p>"So you're going to sit back and let them delist the foxes?" Samantha was astounded.</p>

<p>"I'm still removing whatever traps I find," Conway said. "Just no more protesting. It's too much of a risk. I know you guys probably wanted some kind of a controversy to cover..."</p>

<p>"Well, a picket line in front of the governor's mansion would have made some great footage," said Dave.</p>

<p>"You've got to understand," Conway insisted. "I don't want to see those foxes go extinct, but I don't want myself or my pet getting hurt either. As a matter of fact, I would prefer it if you didn't air this that I'm telling you at all."</p>

<p>Samantha gazed at her notepad, tapping her pen against it. Somehow, she had expected more dedication from Conway. His fear now reminded her of Washburn, cringing and conceding to the brutality of Ulrich and his minions. A sly thought occurred to her, and she glanced up at him. "We won't air it," she accepted.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said.</p>

<p>"...on one condition," the reporter added. "You give us a tour of the tundra."</p>

<p>"Why do you want a tour of the tundra?" asked Conway.</p>

<p>"We want some wildlife footage," said Samantha. "Specifically some shots of the foxes in their natural habitat. They've been exceedingly difficult to get...isn't that right Dave?"</p>

<p>"But Sam, we..." Samantha nudged him, and he agreed rapidly, "Yeah, very difficult!"</p>

<p>Conway looked suspicious, and the two journalists - plus the tomcat - gave him a wide-eyed look. Zachary broke in with a bark: "Yay, the tundra! I want to run!"</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed, "I suppose if I don't come to show you around, you'll go yourself and get lost or attacked by a bear."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Samantha proudly.</p>

<p>"Why are you people from the press so persistent?" he questioned, though not angrily.</p>

<p>"Because we're the press," Samantha responded.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, they were trekking through the snow-covered meadowland. Zachary bounded ahead, like a wolf running through the snow. As they walked, Conway pointed out the arctic wildlife. "You see how rare the foxes are," he mentioned after a while. "We haven't seen a single one yet. Maybe we'll have better luck near the riverbank."</p>

<p>"Sam, I don't get it," Dave whispered to his companion as they followed Conway. "Why are we wandering around the tundra?"</p>

<p>"Roxanne said the hunter's cabin is on land tract A-4," replied Samantha with a grin. "By my estimate I'd say we're nearby. Conway knows the tundra territory; we might have gotten lost if we tried to make it here ourselves, but here we are! Now, all we have to do is sneak over there..."</p>

<p>"We're going to get into trouble," meowed Geronimo, who was sitting on Dave's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry," Samantha declared.</p>

<p>Zachary circled back and barked. Conway stopped and gestured a distance away, where a mother polar bear was watching her two playful cubs. "Polar bears, over there. Did you know that sometimes the foxes follow bears for food? They'll eat scraps of seal meat that the bears catch."</p>

<p>Dave was filming the polar bears, but when Samantha motioned to him the two journalists quietly snuck away.</p>

<p>Conway, his gaze on the polar bears, continued his explanation without realizing. "Polar bears typically hang around the water, because that's where they can find their prey. Speaking of which, the river's close by, although it's probably still frozen over."</p>

<p>Zachary barked, but Conway went on, "I know this bear; I remember seeing her when she was pregnant with her cubs. This is actually her second time rearing cubs..."</p>

<p>Zachary barked again, more incessantly. "Yeah, Zach?" Conway turned to find that he and the dog were alone.</p>

<p>"The news-people are gone," Zachary pointed out.</p>

<p>Conway looked around. They had vanished. "Fuck," he muttered.</p>

<p>Not far away, Ivan and Natasha were padding into the tundra. "I don't know if this is safe, Ivan," said Natasha. "I know the lemmings are coming back to the tundra, but last time we were here we nearly got shot."</p>

<p>"We saw the hunters back there in the woods," Ivan reasoned. "If they're searching the forest right now, then all we have to worry about on the tundra is not stepping in any traps."</p>

<p>"Look, a lemming!" Natasha sprang ahead. The lemming had noticed the foxes too and made a run for it with the vixen in pursuit. It disappeared with a squeak under a stack of firewood, beside a small cabin in the center of the desolate, icy landscape.</p>

<p>"Damn!" yapped Natasha. "I almost had it!"</p>

<p>"Hey Natty," Ivan barked suspiciously, "wasn't this place an abandoned human den? How come there's fresh-cut wood here?"</p>

<p>Natasha looked upward. "...There's smoke coming from the chimney." She hopped up on top of the firewood and peered inside, only to yelp. "Ivan!"</p>

<p>Ivan leapt up next to her and snarled. Hung inside to dry on flat boards of wood were arctic fox pelts.</p>

<p>"This must be where the hunters live," Ivan realized. "We've got to get back and tell Geronimo's humans."</p>

<p>"I'm going to be sick," said Natasha, her ears flat.</p>

<p>Suddenly a net slammed down on them, toppling them off the wood pile and trapping them underneath its mesh. It was Gorgonio.</p>

<p>"No," the hunter answered the fox with a sneer, "you're going to be dead."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave, meanwhile, were walking up a hill of snow. "The hunting cabin should be around here," Samantha said.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we have told Conway what we were up to?" asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Are you kidding, Ger?" said Samantha. "He might erroneously decide that it's too dangerous for a reporter and photographer to look into themselves, and insist that the authorities handle it. There goes our scoop."</p>

<p>"What happens if we actually find the poachers?" Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>"That would be something!" Dave said excitedly. "If we could get an exclusive shot of the poachers with all those fox pelts... Sam, do you think Ted would have us lead our five o'clock broadcast?"</p>

<p>"I think we'd lead at five, six, and eleven and <em>still</em> be in the first block of the morning news tomorrow," an equally excited Samantha answered. "Hey, that must be the hunting lodge!"</p>

<p>"What's a block?" asked Geronimo.</p>

<p>Around the corner of the cabin, Gorgonio had stepped on one corner of the net and pinned the other against the wood pile to be able to aim his rifle.</p>

<p>"How could you be here?" Ivan asked him. "You were in the forest."</p>

<p>"Theron and Venancio were in the forest," Gorgonio corrected. "All those times you two kept escaping from us, and now you've been outfoxed. You're going to wind up as someone's fur coat."</p>

<p>He snapped back the rifle's safety catch...and without warning, a flash of light caught the barrel of the gun, momentarily blinding him. He stepped back in a startled reaction, and saw, standing a few paces behind him, a lady who he recognized as the channel 8 reporter Samantha West, and beside her a man who was the photographer, holding a TV camera - with the light on and pointed straight at him. A cat with Siamese markings was standing at their ankles with his back arched.</p>

<p>"What the..." Gorgonio's voice cut off with a gasp as Ivan leapt up and sank his fangs into his arm. He had inadvertently released the foxes from the net.</p>

<p>At a yap from Natasha, the male fox released the hunter and the two critters ran away. Gorgonio seized the rifle, which he had dropped, but instead of chasing the foxes he spun around to face the journalists. They were standing there, the camera still focused on him. "Give me the tape," he ordered, just as Samantha grabbed Dave's hand and they turned and ran in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Gorgonio was furious. Ignoring the pain from the fox's bite, he fired two or three shots at them. Geronimo, who had leapt back onto Dave's shoulder, let out a surprised meow.</p>

<p>"Those damn poachers don't even respect the press," he hissed.</p>

<p>"The corrupt never do!" answered Samantha.</p>

<p>They half-tumbled down a mound of snow to a frozen river. There was a waterfall here, which had transformed into an icy cliff from the cold. As they tried to race across the ice, Samantha lost her balance; Dave caught her.</p>

<p>Gorgonio appeared at the top of the snowbank. He lifted his rifle and fired at them again, sending zigzagging cracks along the ice, but missing his targets as they hid behind the waterfall.</p>

<p>As he hurried down the slope towards them, barking made him stop in his tracks. Zachary the Husky came bounding over and got in his path, growling.</p>

<p>Conway was right behind Zachary.</p>

<p>Gorgonio frowned. "I was shooting at a rabbit when your dog came running over. He scared it off."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Sorry about that. ...May I see your trapping license?"</p>

<p>The hunter handed over the card for the park ranger to inspect, and when Conway was satisfied he handed it back. He noticed the blood on Gorgonio's sleeve. "How did you get hurt?"</p>

<p>Gorgonio had half-forgotten about the injury. "...oh, nothing."</p>

<p>Zachary was whining at the waterfall, and Conway noticed. "Hey Zach, what's over there?"</p>

<p>The dog ran over, and as Conway followed him, Gorgonio took the opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>Zachary had stopped at the entry to the small cave behind the waterfall. His tail was wagging. "The news-people!"</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave, along with a fluffed Geronimo, were sitting on a rock here. The cave ground was covered in a sheet of ice, which made it difficult for them to move, but the three of them were well-hidden from outside view. "Hi, Zach! ...and Ranger Conway! Not a moment too soon," Samantha smiled.</p>

<p>"...and we saved our tape," added a happy Dave, ejecting it from the camera.</p>

<p>Conway looked befuddled. "Honestly guys, you do realize that you nearly got yourselves killed for a couple of minutes of TV footage, right?"</p>

<p>"We were hiding from that guy you were just talking to. We filmed him trying to kill a couple of foxes and he wanted to destroy the evidence," replied Samantha.</p>

<p>"It's going to be difficult to catch him, but after the tape airs, his picture will be all over the territory. Maybe someone will phone in a tip," said the ranger with a sigh. "When will it be on the news?"</p>

<p>"Tonight," answered Dave. "Maybe that will make him stop hunting for a while."</p>

<p>They all heard a rustling in some nearby bushes, and out came the foxes, Ivan and Natasha.</p>

<p>"Those are the foxes," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" asked Ranger Conway, facing the foxes.</p>

<p>"Yes. Just a little nervous," replied Ivan.</p>

<p>"Maybe you two should go to the cabin, to avoid running into the hunters again today," said Samantha. "Dave and I will go later and we'll all have dinner."</p>

<p>"I like that idea, Ivan," said Natasha. "I don't want to be out here if that bad human returns."</p>

<p>Having said that, the foxes ran off in the direction of the cabin, and the little group, composed of the ranger and the reporters with their cat Geronimo, went on their way.</p>

<p>Eventually, they were back at the ranger station and the reporters and their cat drove off. Conway felt restless, looked at his dog and said, "Zachary, what say we go into the city and see what's happening?"</p>

<p>The dog jumped up and down, wagging his tail.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the ranger.</p><h3>Chapter 15 - The Hideaway</h3>

<p>In the city, Mabel was shopping at a department store. "Mewrrr" her cat Roxanne half mewed and half purred. "Are you sure you can carry all those packages, Madame?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'll manage, Roxy" answered Mabel, "You know this is the best distraction from my loneliness. Without you, kitty, I really would be depressed."</p>

<p>As Mabel and her cat were walking out the store onto the street, a gust of wind blew fiercely and Mabel lost her balance and the grip on her packages, all of them falling to the ground.</p>

<p>She felt a sudden pang of sadness and covered her face with her hands. Suddenly she felt the cat placing a paw on her leg, so she looked down and saw Roxanne looking straight at her with worry. She also noticed someone gathering all the strewn bags. It was Ranger Conway and his dog.</p>

<p>He walked over and they both looked at each other without saying a word, until Mabel found her voice and simply said, "Thanks, friend."</p>

<p>Conway thought she was beautiful. He reached down, helped her up, and smoothed Mabel's hair away from her face. Mabel felt a shiver. She had rarely been treated with such gentleness and she felt a sense of love. Her cat, Roxanne, purred.</p>

<p>Mabel just stared back at Conway, who looked deep into her eyes and whispered, "You are beautiful, Mabel."</p>

<p>Mabel studied his face, partly because it had been such a long time that anyone had said those words to her and partly because she felt a deep attraction to him.</p>

<p>Conway remembered the time they had spent talking in a cafeteria, some weeks ago and he also remembered that he had been thinking about her a lot. Conway was in love with Mabel and he wasn't the type to hide his feelings. He took her face and framed it with his hands, then he kissed her mouth, gently. Mabel let him. She wanted him to kiss her. She had fallen in love too.</p>

<p>The two of them walked off arm in arm, with their cat and dog following behind.</p>

<p>That day, they started a love affair that would last forever.</p><hr>

<p>The video of Gorgonio and the trapped foxes was broadcast on the evening news.</p>

<p>During this time, the poachers were swiftly and secretly moving from the tundra cabin to the regional warehouse. It was mostly Theron and Venancio who did this; Gorgonio only showed up once to order them around, then vanished on the excuse of checking the trap lines. It was already early evening by the time they completed the move.</p>

<p>The interior of the storage facility was dreary and grey and the air was musty from enclosure and disuse; it had corridors lined with storage chambers which created a labyrinth. In addition, the only illumination came from lighting that buzzed furiously and flickered, as windows in the building were sparse. The floor was concrete, while the walls were unpainted red brick; the only modern thing appeared to be the metal divisions between the storage units.</p>

<p>It did not appeal to Venancio. Standing in the center of the large storage unit where they had deposited half of their boxes, he smirked at the surroundings. "Talk about disrepair. We're expected to live in a bunch of unheated, dilapidated storage units! <em>Look</em> at this place...even the lights are flickering out."</p>

<p>"It's just some faulty wiring," Theron responded, a bit more cheerfully. "I'll get to work fixing it."</p>

<p>Venancio glared at him. "You're missing the point, Theron."</p>

<p>It was about this time that Gorgonio walked in nonchalantly, carrying - to Theron's surprise - a small bag of groceries. "Not bad. You didn't unpack anything though, you dimwits."</p>

<p>"You went out in the city to get <em>groceries</em>?" Theron was in disbelief.</p>

<p>"What part of being 'wanted' don't you understand?" Venancio added.</p>

<p>"The part that says I have to stay cooped up terrified of the cops," Gorgonio retorted, then adding, "Open the boxes."</p>

<p>After all the boxes were unpacked, Theron and Venancio began the laborious process of trying to find the proper location for things. It seemed that the imperfect lighting was the result of one of many defective electrical connections. They didn't notice Gorgonio step out of the room.</p>

<p>"Will you look at this," Venancio muttered as they tried to turn on a small television set they had plugged into the wall, "even the <em>outlets</em> don't work!"</p>

<p>"Probably needs to be replaced," Theron considered.</p>

<p>"You do that," Venancio snapped. "Where the hell is Gorgonio, anyway? It's just like him to leave us with all the work. I honestly hope he gets caught if he went out on the town again."</p>

<p>Theron was more interested in the broken outlet. "I think I left all of my electrical stuff in the other room. I'll get it," he said, hurrying out.</p>

<p>Gorgonio was standing in the corridor. Leaning against one of the storage unit doors, he was immersed in scrutinizing something which he had retrieved from his pocket. It was a glass vial containing a clear liquid.</p>

<p>"Hey boss...I've got to get in here," Theron said, motioning to the door. He then noticed what Gorgonio held. "...What've you got there?"</p>

<p>"Something I swiped from somewhere," Gorgonio replied indifferently, but not before Theron could get a look at the label.</p>

<p>"Chloroform?" said Theron.</p>

<p>"Yes, chloroform."</p>

<p>"Why do we need that?"</p>

<p>"Practicality eludes you," Gorgonio responded cryptically. "This happens to be a rather useful little chemical."</p>

<p>"I imagine so...to doctors," Theron answered.</p>

<p>Gorgonio's cell phone rang and when he picked it up, he saw it was Ulrich's phone number. "Fuck," he muttered. "...Yes?"</p>

<p>"How could you have been so <em>stupid</em>?!" the governor's voice berated from the other line. "Letting yourself get filmed by a couple of news reporters out looking for a story! You are one of the most complete idiots..." Gorgonio held the phone away from himself as Ulrich shouted. When he heard silence from the other end, he brought the phone back to his face and spoke into it:</p>

<p>"Look, we've already moved everything out of the cabin and into the warehouse. ...yes, that includes the furs."</p>

<p>"At least you have some sense, however meager," Ulrich said. "I'm signing those foxes off the endangered species list tomorrow and when that goes into effect election night, you're just going to be one of many legally hunting foxes, whether anyone likes it or not. I've already spoken with the ambassador...the meeting tonight is cancelled."</p>

<p>Roxanne nonchalantly padded into the governor's office as he continued speaking. "You'll give Qiang this week's merchandise at the next meeting, along with the usual supply."</p>

<p>"Done," said Gorgonio, "and where do we pick up our money?"</p>

<p>"You'll get that at next week's meeting."</p>

<p>"What?! Since when do we have to wait to get paid?"</p>

<p>"If you want to keep this job then I'd suggest you learn some patience!" The cat was staring intently at the curtains which draped on either side of the office's windows. Roxanne flattened her ears and, extending her claws, leapt and climbed up the fabric. "You'll get paid at the meeting next Friday, same as always. In the meantime, Gorgonio, you get more of those fox pelts; otherwise I'll lose <em>my</em> patience with you!"</p>

<p>At that instant, there was a loud crash as the curtain staff fell; Ulrich turned around to see a lump underneath the curtains. Roxanne poked out her head and purred at Ulrich.</p>

<p>"Damn you, cat!" Ulrich snapped at her as she gracefully shook off the curtains and with a swish of her tail, calmly and indifferently padded out of his office.</p><h3>Chapter 16 - Expenditures</h3>

<p>Samantha and Dave continued their investigating relentlessly at the station. Geronimo joined in half-heartedly. After seeing how close they had come to being shot on the tundra, he had begun rethinking the excitement of the journalism profession. Now that he had a taste of how real the danger was, he couldn't comprehend why his humans seemed ever more intent on persisting with the story.</p>

<p>It was late in the day when Samantha received another phone call at the office, from Roxanne. The TV news crew met her at the casino's roulette wheel.</p>

<p>"Denise is paying the hunters through a phony company." Roxanne got right to the point. "She heads a firm called 'Nortenya Landscaping', which has a regional contract to supposedly plant trees along Nortenya's highways. The only people her firm employs are the three poachers. Incidentally, the highways have no trees."</p>

<p>A look at the regional expenditures - which they had gotten before to see if money was being laundered by some other means - confirmed the existence of Nortenya Landscaping, and that it was being paid over $500,000. Documents on file showed the business was listed as belonging to Denise Ralston, and her only three employees - Seth Gorgonio, Luke Theron, and Virgil Venancio - combined, earned the exact amount the firm was getting from the region.</p>

<p>Early next morning, Samantha and Dave drove to the address listed for the business and found an unmarked office in a Vaharis shopping center, with only a table, two chairs, and a telephone inside. The door was locked.</p>

<p>When Samantha placed a telephone call to the treasurer's office, the secretary told the reporter that Denise was on her lunch break. So the two journalists decided to go in person to her office.</p>

<p>As they got off the elevator on the second floor, they turned the corner and there was a lobby area with a secretarial desk, a bookcase to her right, and behind her a long corridor which led to the treasury offices.</p>

<p>"May I help you?" the secretary asked as they walked up.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had called on the phone earlier; Samantha West from WCAT television news?" said the reporter. "We have some questions we'd like to ask Ms. Ralston..."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Ms. Ralston isn't in right now. She's in a meeting."</p>

<p>"When will the meeting be over?"</p>

<p>"I can't say."</p>

<p>Samantha was, by nature, an observant person. She noticed the woman's nervousness and concluded that something was amiss.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Perhaps we'll come back at a later time," the reporter answered.</p>

<p>Dave glanced at her, but said nothing.</p>

<p>The pair turned around and walked back to the elevator and as they turned the corner, Dave said, "What's the scheme, Sam?"</p>

<p>The reporter's green eyes sparkled with excitement. "Just wait and see," she said.</p>

<p>The two stayed in the elevator area hidden around the corner. Samantha peeked out every now and then towards the lobby desk; and within ten minutes the secretary got up and went into a side door marked 'restrooms'.</p>

<p>"Now" said Samantha, "Get the camera rolling."</p>

<p>She quickly walked past the desk and into the corridor with Dave following close behind.</p>

<p>The first office they found was the one they were looking for; the sign on the wall said: Denise Ralston, Treasurer.</p>

<p>Denise was standing near a window, smoking a cigarette and turned her head in time to see the reporters walk in.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing in here!?" she yelled, her face getting flushed.</p>

<p>"Just a few minutes of your time, Ms. Ralston," said Samantha, quickly adding, "We wanted to know why a firm you own is being paid over $500,ooo by the region for trees it never planted?"</p>

<p>"No comment," Denise retorted, seeming surprised.</p>

<p>"Why is that complete sum going to your only three employees, one of which happens to be wanted by the authorities for poaching arctic foxes? Doesn't your company have any other expenses?"</p>

<p>"None of your damn business. Get out of my office." snapped Denise.</p>

<p>"It's the people's money, and therefore it <em>is</em> my business to report it," Samantha snapped back.</p>

<p>"I don't give a fuck about 'the people'. My high level in society doesn't answer to the lower masses" Denise was fuming.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you deny the funneling of money that is taking place out of the region's Treasury department and ending up in the pockets of a wanted poacher?" the reporter persisted.</p>

<p>"Fuck you bitch!" Denise screamed.</p>

<p>Samantha smiled and said, "You represent your 'high level in society' very well."</p>

<p>"Security!" Denise yelled at the top of her lungs, but before any guards arrived, Samantha and Dave had left the office, walked past a very astonished secretary and entered the elevator.</p>

<p>"Dave." Samantha looked at her trusted photographer.</p>

<p>"Sam." he answered, "Every word and picture was captured on film."</p>

<p>"Let's see her try to deny her words," she responded.</p><hr>

<p>Governor Victor Ulrich glanced up from the television as Denise stormed into his office. Roxanne was seated on a sofa to the side of the room; she growled as the treasurer, holding the fox stole, approached Ulrich.</p>

<p>"This is the last straw," Denise said indignantly, "I have had enough of those pesky, good-for-nothing journalists poking around!"</p>

<p>"All journalists are pesky and good for nothing," Ulrich interrupted, indifferently lighting a cigarette. "Which of the many are we talking about?"</p>

<p>"Don't be snide." Denise was furious. "It's that television reporter Samantha West! She actually <em>dared</em> to waltz into my office and question me! I want you to do something about her. Hell, I want to deal with that gossipy bitch <em>personally</em>..."</p>

<p>Her voice trailed as she glanced at the television set. Channel 8 was playing the film of Samantha confronting her in the office, and her outraged reaction.</p>

<p>"I've told you to maintain your composure," Ulrich responded casually when she pointed to the TV.</p>

<p>"If you had paid attention to me, they wouldn't have found out how we were laundering the money," Denise demanded.</p>

<p>"Denise," said Ulrich, calmly, "As you said, they're <em>journalists</em>. Journalists are always going to annoy. That's what they do. Sooner or later they'll either get bored of investigating, or their editor will. Besides, that reporter can't do anything about us. Even if she discovered the whole conspiracy, what good would it do? People trust us, Denise."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't if they knew," Denise responded.</p>

<p>"They won't know, but even if they did they can't do anything, nor would they. I'm too revered by the public to be brought down by a news story. Nortenya is mine, soon all of Sarrilla will be, and no one can stop me."</p>

<p>"Fine, I see your popularity is going to your head. When we're all standing in court then we'll see how influential you are getting us off lightly," Denise said, swinging the fox stole over her shoulder and walking briskly out of the office.</p>

<p>Samantha's voice came from the television: "...One of the three employees of Nortenya Landscaping is listed as Seth Gorgonio. We couldn't find anyone by this name in the city directory...however, according to a source within the governor's mansion, this is the same person who was identified as being involved with the arctic fox poaching. Reporting Live, Samantha West, WCAT 8 News."</p>

<p>This made Ulrich turn back towards the television, analyzing the reporter's words. "She has an anonymous source," he considered aloud. "Someone here is tipping off the press."</p>

<p>At this point, Roxanne leapt on the desk and scratched behind an ear.</p>

<p>"Get off my desk, you're shedding fur everywhere, and get out of my office!" Ulrich yelled at the cat.</p>

<p>Roxanne calmly jumped off the desk, hissed at him, and ran out the door.</p><hr>

<p>Meanwhile, the hunters had gone into Hammond Forest early that morning to trap more foxes. The fur exchange meeting was election night, and they were short on their quota of fox pelts. Arctic foxes were becoming scarcer, and with each one they caught their rarity increased. Gorgonio headed in one direction, while Theron and Venancio headed in the other.</p>

<p>Venancio glanced down at the snow and noticed some pawprints. "These fox tracks look fresh. Theron, go after them; I'm going to check the other trap line we set over there."</p>

<p>During this time, Ivan and Natasha were padding through the snow, their jaws full of lemmings. They found lemmings easily all around the forest and after catching some to eat instantly, they determined to get some to cache away for later. After the famine earlier that winter, the present profusion of the rodents was like a bonanza to the arctic foxes, and they were trying to take full advantage of it until the inevitable population crash of the lemmings.</p>

<p>It was Ivan and Natasha's tracks the hunters had encountered. Theron followed the trail to a section of the woods bordered on one side by a creek, which had frozen over, and a line of small bushes. Here, he saw the foxes walking along and he crouched down to stay out of sight. <em>Those are the same two foxes we keep meeting.</em></p>

<p>The foxes had not noticed him, and from where he was hiding, he had a clear shot at them, but as he lifted the rifle he felt a sudden pang of pity for them. He had never noticed how small these animals were.</p>

<p>"Theron!" He could hear Venancio coming and in a sudden decision, he brushed the rifle against the dry leaves to make a loud noise. The foxes turned to look at him and froze. He waved them off, and they ran away.</p>

<p>Venancio came up behind him in the same instant that the foxes fled into the bracken. "What the <em>fuck</em>, Theron!" he snapped, infuriated, "you almost had them!"</p>

<p>"The rifle jammed," Theron said. Inwardly, he felt at peace knowing that he had spared the lives of the innocent animals.</p>

<p>It was then that Gorgonio arrived, carrying not one but five fox skins.</p>

<p>"Well, you've had good luck hunting," Venancio observed, "unlike some of us. Where'd you find so many of them?"</p>

<p>The lead poacher glared at Venancio. "Don't tell me you didn't catch any of those animals."</p>

<p>"Hey, it was his fault," Venancio immediately spoke up, gesturing to Theron. "He had a clear shot at two foxes and he didn't fire."</p>

<p>"My rifle jammed!" Theron insisted. "Besides, you're the one placing traps where the rangers can find them!"</p>

<p>"You morons," Gorgonio scoffed. "How hard is it for you two to skin a couple of damned foxes? Or do I have to do everything? Theron, take these back to the warehouse and make sure everything's ok over there." Turning to Venancio, he said, "You and I are going to finish checking the traps."</p>

<p>Theron was glad to leave; the whole business of poaching was making him feel ill.</p>

<p>When evening came, Gorgonio and Venancio returned to the warehouse. The hallways were immensely dark, due to the fact that the lights were off, but when Gorgonio went to switch them on they remained off. He looked up at the wire mesh that ran across the ceiling and realized the lights had been removed. A faint glow came from one of the storage units down the hall, and he walked over to it, irritated.</p>

<p>In one of the warehouse's abandoned storage units, the hunters had found a couple of chairs and a table, both oaken and of an antique design, which Denise said were hers; however, as she presently had no use for them they were left in the warehouse. Sitting at the wood table was Theron, tinkering around with one of the long fluorescent lights. He had it connected to a nondescript black box with some kind of meter and dial on the front, and which was plugged into the wall outlet. Two wires ending in copper rods snaked out of the device; Theron was holding them to the light.</p>

<p>Sensing Gorgonio's presence at the entryway, Theron glanced up.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing?" Gorgonio demanded.</p>

<p>Theron lifted the wires. The fluorescent light went dark. "I was trying to fix the lighting," he said, placing the wires on the table. "It seems it's the wiring that's bad...the lights seem to work fine."</p>

<p>"I don't give a shit," Gorgonio complained. He was eyeing the device on the table and after a short pause he spoke again, his voice less accusatory. "That thing you have there..." he began.</p>

<p>"It's a power source," Theron said proudly.</p>

<p>"A <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a transformer with a dial to regulate the electricity...you plug it into the wall and it amplifies the alternating current from..."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I don't care." Gorgonio impatiently said. "What about these copper things...?"</p>

<p>"They're electrodes. ...Don't!" Theron warned as Gorgonio reached for them, but it was too late. Gorgonio jerked back, his hands gripping the copper. The needle on the meter rose only slightly, but his reaction was violent and agonized.</p>

<p>"Get them off! Get them off!" he screamed, and Theron pulled the plug out of the outlet. Gorgonio released the electrodes and fell backwards onto the floor.</p>

<p>"Are you OK?" Theron asked.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" yelled Gorgonio. "I could have gotten electrocuted! Hook the lights back up and put that shit away!"</p>

<p>Theron didn't respond and did as he was told.</p><hr>

<p>That evening, the reporter and her cameraman went out again. When Samantha and Dave arrived at the plaza in front of the governor's mansion, they found that their competitors, Channel 5 and Channel 13, had arrived earlier than they had.</p>

<p>"Damn it," Dave remarked, as he parked the news van on the side of the plaza, "There go all the good camera angles."</p>

<p>"We've got a lot to cover, Dave," said Samantha. "Not only do we need the footage of Ulrich signing the foxes off the endangered species list, but Devon wants this story about the ice rink opening for the 11 o'clock newscast."</p>

<p>"I still say we should just go on the air saying Ulrich's a crook and leave it at that," a familiar feline voice chimed in from the back of the news van.</p>

<p>"Geronimo," Dave said.</p>

<p>"I'm not even surprised anymore," sighed Samantha.</p>

<p>There was already a cluster of press cameras around a podium which had been set up in front of the ice rink. It was a dual event: the opening of the new ice rink, and the delisting of the arctic fox. Samantha and Dave would be covering both, but the more important event was the delisting.</p>

<p>They found a spot on the side, where Dave set up the tripod and camera. Samantha took the microphone, on a small stand, and placed it on the podium alongside the competitors'. She made sure that the Channel 8 microphone flag was visible on-camera. It was windy and very cold. The governor arrived half-an-hour late, as politicians were so apt to do when holding a press conference outdoors.</p>

<p>Governor Victor Ulrich gave some remarks about the ice rink, and then turned to the matter of the arctic foxes. He gave a showy speech about the spectacular thing that he had done of reviving the dwindling arctic fox numbers, and in clear defiance he also spoke of the boon this would be to local furriers and the hunting tourism that would come to Nortenya. Geronimo listened attentively to the speech. This was the first time Geronimo had seen Ulrich in person, and the cat could immediately sense there was something dishonest and untrustworthy about the governor.</p>

<p>Under the lights of the press cameras and to the applause of his political adherents standing behind him, Ulrich signed the remaining document to remove the arctic fox from the endangered species list. Only Samantha and Dave seemed to fully comprehend that he was signing the animals into extinction. In one week, Friday at midnight, the foxes would be classified as just another fur-bearer and Governor Ulrich would almost certainly be celebrating his second term in office. If there was any doubt of his winning the election, his being the one who ostensibly brought the arctic fox back from extinction sealed it in the polls. Samantha and Dave had a new deadline.</p>

<p>After the paperwork was signed, there was a brief opportunity for the press to ask questions. A newspaper reporter asked something about how much funding the region had given towards the ice rink construction, but that was all.</p>

<p>Samantha asked, "Governor, is there any concern that delisting the foxes now, with poachers after them, might be a bad idea?"</p>

<p>"The foxes have recovered," replied Ulrich. "Certainly it is an affront, and my office is doing all we can to bring these criminals to justice. The fox population is abundant and thriving and we have not seen any negative impact. Anyone else?"</p>

<p>It was a clearly scripted answer.</p>

<p>There was silence, and as Ulrich said, "Ok," and turned to leave, Samantha spoke up again:</p>

<p>"Any comment on the fact that one of the poachers was found listed as an employee of a landscaping company owned by treasurer Denise Ralston?" All the media turned their attention once again to the governor.</p>

<p>"No," Ulrich answered bluntly.</p>

<p>"What about the...?"</p>

<p>"Ms. West," Ulrich smiled in an almost hostile way, "Arctic foxes recovering is a rare piece of good news. I hope you are not trying to misrepresent this happy event to get higher ratings."</p>

<p><em>Just like we all hope you're not lying about the foxes recovering to get higher poll numbers.</em> It was a tempting retort, but Samantha caught herself. She knew her place was to report what was happening and let the viewers decide, not to give her opinion.</p>

<p>As everyone dispersed, Samantha and Dave walked around the ice rink. There were already people skating on it. Geronimo chased after the two journalists.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do my stand-up segment on the ice," declared Samantha.</p>

<p>"You don't know how to ice-skate," Dave pointed out.</p>

<p>"I'll hang on to the banister," replied Samantha.</p>

<p>Samantha seized hold of the railing and tentatively walked onto the margin of the rink, holding her microphone with one hand. She turned to Dave, who had the camera focused on the skaters; Geronimo was sitting underneath the tripod.</p>

<p>"I'll walk towards you," Samantha told him.</p>

<p>"Ok," agreed the cameraman. "I'll start on the skaters and then I'll pan over to you."</p>

<p>"Take one," announced Samantha.</p>

<p>She began speaking as the camera's white light covered her:</p>

<p>"This ice rink is one of several projects receiving regional funding..."</p>

<p>She cut off with a small gasp as she fell down.</p>

<p>"Take two," Dave said matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"It's not as easy as it looks," Samantha acquiesced.</p>

<p>Samantha tried to get up but fell again. She had slid away from the railing. "Dave, help me up," she said.</p>

<p>Dave tried to grab her hand but couldn't reach her.</p>

<p>A yap made Samantha glance over. Ivan and Natasha were both sitting on the ice, watching them. They padded over, their fur-covered paws providing traction just as when they had first met Geronimo. "You can't get up...?" questioned Ivan.</p>

<p>"I guess not," answered Samantha.</p>

<p>The two foxes grabbed hold of her sleeve and pulled her to where she could once more grab hold of the railing. "Thanks," said the reporter.</p>

<p>"Arctic foxes, here in the city?" It was Ulrich. He was standing a short distance away, flanked by his bodyguards, and watching the two fluffy critters.</p>

<p>"They're my friends," offered Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Fine quality fur," he said pensively, ignoring the cat’s comment. “They’re in their winter prime.”</p>

<p>Ivan flattened his ears and, with a swish of his tail, he and Natasha trotted off. The vixen whispered to her mate, “That man frightens me.”</p>

<p>Ulrich spoke to the journalists. "It's remarkable how you befriended those animals...much the same way as you've befriended someone close to my office."</p>

<p>When neither Samantha nor Dave spoke, he went on, "I would very much like to know who."</p>

<p>"Journalist's ethics," Samantha said. "We never reveal our sources."</p>

<p>"So I've heard," Ulrich replied.</p>

<p>With a motion to his entourage, the governor left.</p><h3>Chapter 17 - City foxes</h3>

<p>Ulrich arrived at the governor's mansion in a bad mood. Instead of going to his quarters for dinner, he went to his office.</p>

<p>"News reporters are a nuisance," he grumbled.</p>

<p>He picked up the phone and dialed. Gorgonio the hunter, answered it.</p>

<p>"Yeah, what."</p>

<p>"I have a small task for you," said the governor.</p>

<p>"We're still trying to fill your quota for the week..." began the hunter.</p>

<p>"This will tie in nicely with that," interrupted Ulrich. "There are two stray foxes running around in the city. I want you or one of your men to pick them up. Their fur is excellent."</p>

<p>Gorgonio hesitated, then questioned, "In the city? I've never seen a fox or any other wild animal wander in."</p>

<p>"Well, they're there, I saw them tonight around the skating rink; and what's more, it seems that those pesky reporters West and Candid know them. Find those foxes and kill them. I want those furs," ordered the governor.</p>

<p>"Ok." Gorgonio answered simply, and heard the phone line hang up.</p>

<p>"Venancio! Theron!" he called out to his partners.</p>

<p>The two men came into the room.</p>

<p>"What are you yelling about?!" Venancio yelled back, "I'm not deaf you know."</p>

<p>Theron leaned back against a table, stuck his hands in his pockets and said nothing.</p>

<p>"I've got a chore for you," Gorgonio told Venancio.</p>

<p>"More? Theron and me barely got finished packing that last batch of hides," was the response.</p>

<p>"Whatever," Gorgonio seemed annoyed. "Ulrich saw a couple of foxes running around in the city near the skating rink and wants us to get them. Good quality fur, he says. I want you to go get it done."</p>

<p>"Why me? Why not Theron, or you?"</p>

<p>"Because, you dimwit, I got cops looking for me...and I need Theron here to finish some repairs." Gorgonio said glancing at Theron, who remained silent.</p>

<p>Venancio did not answer. He turned around and grabbing a revolver, checked to see if it was loaded and hid it in his inside jacket pocket. "Let's hope they're still wandering in the same area," he said, and went out the door.</p>

<p>The city skating rink was full of people when Venancio arrived. He looked around but saw no signs of any animals. He got back in the truck, drove around for a few blocks and then he saw them. Foxes. Two arctic foxes sitting underneath a tree in a small park that served as an oasis in the city.</p>

<p>He parked his truck out of their line of sight, and walked slowly towards them.</p>

<p>The foxes, Ivan and Natasha, were resting, but their senses were alert and they both picked up their ears. Ivan raised his nose to the air and sniffed. "Human. Approaching," he said to his mate.</p>

<p>By now, Natasha was also smelling the scent. "Yes, it's male."</p>

<p>"His intentions are not good," said Ivan.</p>

<p>Natasha nodded her head in agreement.</p>

<p>The two foxes got up and ran as fast as they could in the opposite direction of the hunter, but Venancio saw them and gave chase. They fled into the city area but the hunter was determined and kept up.</p>

<p>The animals ran past stores, and through small crowds of people who eyed them with interest but didn't try to discover what the chase was about. Then they came to a corner and as soon as the foxes turned it, they almost ran into Geronimo and Roxanne who were walking around.</p>

<p>With no time to spare, they ran past them, meeting their eyes as the thought of danger crossed their minds. The cats picked up on the thought, and chased after the foxes, passing them and motioning for them to follow.</p>

<p>Roxanne and Geronimo took them to an alleyway where the side door of the coffee shop was, and there, sitting near the warmth of the heating vent, was Zachary, the ranger's dog. He was waiting for his human who had gone in to speak with the owner of the coffee shop.</p>

<p>Zachary looked up with surprise when he saw the bunch of critters run over to him with their fur frizzed.</p>

<p>"What's happening?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not much time to explain," responded Ivan, "We're being chased and it looks like one of the hunters that tried to capture us the other day."</p>

<p>"In the middle of the <em>city</em>? Hide," said the dog. "I'll stand guard while you cats distract him."</p>

<p>"Of course. We'll sit here with the dog and make the hunter think that he's been chasing us all the time," purred Roxanne.</p>

<p>"That human is so stupid, he'll believe it," added Geronimo.</p>

<p>"And...just in case he has doubts," snarled Zachary, "my growling fangs will persuade him."</p>

<p>The foxes quickly hid behind some garbage cans and the dog positioned himself in front of them, while the cats sat before the dog and waited.</p>

<p>They didn't have to wait for long. Venancio turned the corner within minutes and found himself looking at an angry dog and two cats.</p>

<p>"Cats?" he said looking at them. "No. I'm sure I was chasing foxes."</p>

<p>He thought for a minute, then reached for his gun. "Maybe you know where the foxes are...tell me."</p>

<p>He pointed his revolver at the animals, but before any one of them could leap at him, the back door of the shop opened, and out stepped Ranger Jovan Conway. "What's going on here?" he asked, pulling out his own gun.</p>

<p>Venancio gave no answer. He turned and ran all the way back to his truck.</p>

<p>Conway didn't give chase. He put his gun back in the holster and patted his dog on the head, checking on the cats as well. He saw the two foxes emerge from behind the trash bins.</p>

<p>"So that's it," he said. "You foxes have lots of friends ready to help you, but I don't think you should be wandering into the city area anymore."</p>

<p>"You're right." answered Ivan.</p>

<p>"We'll stay in the forest," added Natasha.</p>

<p>"Come on," said the ranger, "I'll drop you off at my cabin. You can stay there, or go to the reporters' place. I heard you've been staying there lately."</p>

<p>"Thank you. That'll do nicely," said Ivan.</p>

<p>"You cats did the right thing," said Conway, "and of course, my faithful dog," he added, petting the dog's head. Zachary wagged his tail happily.</p>

<p>The two cats padded off and soon met with Samantha and Dave, who were walking down the sidewalk to the news van. The journalists had stopped by a store to buy some groceries before returning to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, there you are!" Samantha said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"We got you some of those sardines you like," added Dave.</p>

<p>Geronimo purred loudly and turned to Roxanne. "Would you like to come to the lodge and eat with us?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, but my human Mabel will be missing me," Roxanne purred back. "I'll see you later, Geronimo."</p>

<p>Roxanne touched noses with Geronimo and bounded off towards the governor's mansion.</p><hr>

<p>Back at the storage warehouse, Venancio had returned. He sheepishly walked into the room where Gorgonio was sitting.</p>

<p>"No pelts," Gorgonio observed.</p>

<p>"They've got these other animals helping them," Venancio tried to justify. "Two cats and this big wolf-dog..."</p>

<p>Gorgonio would have none of it. He banged his fist on the table and thundered:</p>

<p>"Fuck it, Venancio, I don't care who they've got helping them! The governor wants those foxes. From the sound of it, they're the same two foxes that keep evading us and <em>I</em> want their skins if only as trophies! Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be done," responded Venancio, looking defiantly at Gorgonio.</p>

<p>Theron walked in and, ignoring the scene before him, simply stated, "All the electrical outlets are functioning properly."</p>

<p>Gorgonio looked from Venancio to Theron and back, saying, "We'll deal with this fox issue later. If Ulrich asks, we'll say we're still hunting them and to hell with it."</p><h3>Chapter 18 - The Longguo Ambassador</h3>

<p>Samantha and Dave had only two days left to verify all that their anonymous source had said. The election was tomorrow, and with it arctic fox hunting season would officially open. The matter of Denise and the landscaping company had made for an interesting investigative report, but it did not prove definitively that the poachers were being paid to hunt foxes, nor did it address the involvement of Ulrich or the Longguo government. There was no document - public or at the very least, obtainable - which they could use as proof of the corruption, so what remained was what Samantha had wanted to leave for last: the confrontation interviews.</p>

<p>Both the reporter and her cameraman knew these would not be easy tasks. It was one thing to simply get the statements of Ulrich and Qiang; it was quite another to try to trick them into revealing the corruption - and consequently, verifying Roxanne's account. Neither was certain what would be done if this also failed...airing an incomplete report consisting solely of an anonymous source's charges was out of the question. Nevertheless, Samantha and Dave remained positive and determined to reveal the truth somehow.</p>

<p>It was common newsroom knowledge that the ambassador generally did not grant interviews to foreign journalists. Samantha ascertained this was likely because of the straightforwardness of these interviews - the inquiries mostly relating to the human rights abuses taking place in Longguo, and the distrust between Longguo and Sarrilla. If Qiang only wanted the favorable coverage that his country's censored news media gave, then Samantha would pretend to be doing a sympathetic human interest story. They had the perfect one...the upcoming anniversary of the present Longguo regime's capture of power. Hinting over the telephone that this was the story she was covering was enough to secure an interview with Ambassador Qiang for later that day.</p>

<p>They were more blatant with Governor Ulrich. Samantha dryly informed him over the phone that her news network had potentially damaging information it would be airing, which behooved him to give an explanation. They got the interview with Ulrich scheduled before Qiang's.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly that day and the weather was becoming warmer. Samantha and Dave were able to forgo their winter coats, the reporter wearing her typical office attire and the cameraman with a hooded sweater.</p>

<p>They left Geronimo at the TV station and made it to the governor's mansion early. They had the camera rolling as they were waved into his office by his secretary, and they found him seated at his desk, watching television. He was channel-surfing with the remote control, but upon seeing the pair he returned the television to WCAT's channel and shut it off.</p>

<p>"Ms. West; Mr. Candid." His pale blue eyes held an evident dislike of them, yet his voice was smooth and maintained the charm expected of a politician running for re-election. "I was told you had received some...incomplete information?"</p>

<p>"It's complete," Samantha told him. "All we'd like to have is your explanation of <em>why</em>."</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"We have proof you're the one financing the fox poaching, and that you're involved in the poaching ring in which the furs are sold to a foreign dignitary. Do you have any comment on that?" bluffed Samantha.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Ulrich. "You have everything mixed up. The information you have is entirely false."</p>

<p>"Why is it false?"</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> information is rather sensitive," he said, with a glance at the camera.</p>

<p>"You're not the Minister of Defense," Samantha squinted at him.</p>

<p>"Ms. West," said Ulrich, almost as if trying to explain something rudimentary, "I am prepared to offer you a complete explanation, but only if that explanation is kept <em>off the record</em>. Surely," he added with another sharp glare at the camera, "you don't want to be airing an <em>untrue</em> story?"</p>

<p>Samantha eyed him suspiciously; he glared back at her, well aware that he had the upper hand. Eventually, Dave murmured to Samantha, "I'm shutting the camera off."</p>

<p>He clicked it off, and Samantha sighed. Ulrich looked satisfied. "All right," Samantha said, "What is this 'sensitive' information?"</p>

<p>Ulrich leaned back, visibly more relaxed now that they were no longer recording. "Samantha West," he began, retrieving a small box of cigarettes from his pocket, "I understand your desire to cover this story. The media isn't all that different from any other business. It's all a matter of consumers...high TV ratings." He offered her one of the cigarettes; when she declined, he lit it with a small lighter and began smoking. "Scandal has always been a favorite of your profession. The masses adore it. And you - both of you - recognize opportunity. You notice the story where the rest only see politics. In that way, you aren't that different from most entrepreneurs; though you've been successful in your field for more than that. I've seen quite a few of your news stories, and I am well aware that together you are one of your station's greatest assets. Candid, your films are very thorough, and they make an excellent accompaniment to West's talent, and - if I may say - beauty? ...Do you always work on stories as a team?"</p>

<p>"Cut the flattery and get to the point," Samantha hissed.</p>

<p>"My point is, Ms. West, that certainly you must realize your potential goes beyond the meager rewards of news reporting. A reporter's salary isn't that much. Certainly not befitting you."</p>

<p>He stood up from his seat and walked around to where they were. "Haven’t you ever wanted to travel? On pleasure, not business. Go shopping maybe; get yourself a fox coat..."</p>

<p>Samantha glanced over at Dave, who was visibly annoyed, but turned to look the governor straight in the eyes at this remark.</p>

<p>"...<em>Arctic</em> fox?" she asked.</p>

<p>Ulrich smiled, without saying a word; almost as if suggesting that if she so desired it, he would procure the fur coat for her. "So perhaps we can come to an understanding," the governor said. He walked back to his desk, and sat down. "I have been known to be quite generous. Say...50,000? Each."</p>

<p>There was a pause as the offer sank in. "Why, governor," said Samantha, "when you put it <em>that</em> way..."</p>

<p>Ulrich seemed content, as if he was certain he had won the two journalists over. Samantha, however, was not finished. "...I start to realize how scared you really are about the truth. What's so terrifying about a few prying questions from a TV reporter? Do you really think you can <em>bribe</em> us? I'm a journalist, Ulrich...not one of your PR propagandists."</p>

<p>"I suggest you reconsider my offer, Ms. West," Ulrich said tersely. "I'm not going to make it twice."</p>

<p>"Go to hell," said Samantha.</p>

<p>Dave's affronted look at Ulrich's offer told him the photographer felt the same as Samantha. The governor smiled again, though almost in amusement as he looked down at the cigarette he held. "Talent," he mused, "but no foresight." He gave Samantha a furious glare. "Seeing as I can't reason with you, consider this advice. Drop the poaching story."</p>

<p>Samantha glared back at him. "Or...?"</p>

<p>"...Let's say WCAT will be airing a very touching memorial for two of its most beloved journalists." Ulrich's voice was low, but he kept his gaze fixed on Samantha.</p>

<p>Samantha didn't flinch. "Forgot that Sarrilla has freedom of the press, have we?"</p>

<p>"One of the most obsolete parts of the Sarrillian constitution," Ulrich retorted.</p>

<p>"Care to repeat that on the record?" Dave responded as he switched the camera back on. Its bright light shone over the reporter and the politician, who were still facing each other; like a cat with her back arched, daring a much larger wolf to pounce. There was silence for a moment, until finally Ulrich looked straight at the reporter and snarled, "No comment."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," Samantha whispered.</p>

<p>"Get the hell out of my office." he added.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave turned and left.</p><hr>

<p>From the governor's mansion, Samantha and Dave headed straight to the Longguo Embassy. There was little time to stop and have lunch, although even if there had been, they knew it was better to get to their second interview quickly. Should Ulrich have decided to contact his business associate about the pair's investigation, they would no longer have the advantage of surprise.</p>

<p>They arrived at the Longguo Embassy and were told curtly by a guard to wait. Shortly afterward, Qiang came out personally to greet them.</p>

<p>"Ambassador Qiang Xue?" said Samantha.</p>

<p>"Samantha Verity West, very pleased to meet you," he replied in a pleasant voice, shaking her hand. More sharply, he said to his secretary in Chinese: "Get cups of tea." When she wordlessly turned to this task, he spoke again to the reporter, "Won't you come into my office and sit?"</p>

<p><em>He's very polite now,</em> Samantha was thinking as she and Dave stepped into the ambassador's office,<em> a 180 degree difference from what they're saying back at the newsroom. No doubt it's because he thinks we're here doing some uncritical feature story. I can just imagine his reaction when he figures out what we're really covering.</em> She sat down at one of the chairs at the desk while Dave set up a camera and tripod; as the ambassador was sitting down, she glanced at her notepad and said, "So, it's been a year since the Longguo revolt?"</p>

<p>"Correct," the ambassador affirmed.</p>

<p>"And what do you feel has been accomplished in Longguo since then?" Samantha added, "What improvements have occurred because of it?"</p>

<p>Qiang seemed delighted with her question. "We have a new and better society," Qiang began, "Production is up at our factories; our economy is strong and vibrant..."</p>

<p>His long speech praising the benefits - real or imagined - that came from the coup d’état in Longguo, lasted for what seemed to Samantha like an eternity, during which time she patiently took notes and kept an eye on the secretary, who was preparing the tea. She glanced over at Dave, who looked just as bored as she was; when Qiang finally finished, she jumped to ask the next question.</p>

<p>"What about business overseas? ...There's a lot of trade between Sarrilla and Longguo, isn't there?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sarrilla is one of Longguo's greatest trade partners," Qiang answered.</p>

<p>"Including arctic fox pelts?"</p>

<p>There was stunned silence for a moment, during which the only sound was when the telephone outside his office began to ring, and the secretary quickly left the teacups to answer it. When Qiang remained speechless from astonishment, Samantha dropped her voice down to a whisper. "Now, let's be frank, ambassador. We know the Nortenya governor, Victor Ulrich, is selling you the fox skins which you ship to Longguo. It doesn't matter to me; I've always rather admired Longguo's system and so I'm not extremely interested in your buying the furs. I'm more interested in what this means as far as Ulrich goes."</p>

<p>"Ambassador Qiang?" It was the secretary, holding the telephone receiver and standing at the office doorway. She spoke in their native Chinese language. "The governor of Nortenya is on the line; he would like to speak with you."</p>

<p>"Tell him to wait!" Qiang snapped at his secretary, in the same language. "I'll be at the warehouse office at 11 p.m. tomorrow; he can explain about these journalists then!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ambassador," she said, turning wearily back to the telephone receiver.</p>

<p>Qiang turned back to the reporter, who was staring expressionless at him.</p>

<p>"I have no idea what you are talking about," Qiang told her in a docile voice.</p>

<p>"No idea?" Samantha persisted.</p>

<p>"None." Qiang seemed irked.</p>

<p>"So then you have no knowledge of the fact that your embassy is shipping arctic fox pelts to Longguo?"</p>

<p>"No comment."</p>

<p>"What about the secret business arrangement you have with Governor Ulrich? Doesn't that undermine whatever trust your embassy was trying to build between Longguo and Sarrilla?"</p>

<p>"No comment," Qiang retorted. "Who has been telling you these lies?"</p>

<p>"No comment," the reporter quickly responded.</p>

<p>The diplomat glared at her. His secretary walked in at this point with the tea, as Qiang told Samantha: "You unscrupulous reporters have no reverence for those in power. In my country," he added, the look in his eyes hinting at some unspoken cruelty, "we have special ways of reasoning with your kind."</p>

<p>"This is not Longguo," said Samantha calmly. "In Sarrilla we have freedom of the press and speech. Our people are an informed, educated society that takes truth seriously...not to mention humane treatment of all living things."</p>

<p>"Get out," ordered Qiang.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see a smile spread across the reporter's face.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your time, ambassador," Samantha said. "Have a nice day."</p>

<p>That being said, the reporter and her cameraman left the office.</p>

<p>Once they were outside, Samantha turned to Dave and grinned. "Let's go get something to eat, Dave," she said. "We just got our story."</p><hr>

<p>The two journalists went to the Chinese restaurant where they had previously waited for Washburn. They ordered food, and as they were waiting, Samantha explained:</p>

<p>"Ambassador Qiang said he would be at the warehouse at 11 p.m. tomorrow, and that he expects Governor Ulrich to explain our investigating then. Tomorrow is a Friday, and if the warehouse is the same one where the poachers were spotted and Washburn was shot..."</p>

<p>"...that means we've got the time and place for the fox fur exchange," Dave finished.</p>

<p>"He said it was an office within the warehouse," elaborated Samantha.</p>

<p>"Roxanne told us there was an office in the regional warehouse," the cameraman said. "Sam, if Qiang knew you spoke Chinese, he would kill you."</p>

<p>When the waiter came with the food and drinks, the manager was following. "...If Ambassador Qiang says he wants these journalists dead, then you do not question it," he was insisting to the waiter. "One sip of these drinks and the paramedics won't get here in time to save them." He turned to Samantha and Dave and in a rather coy way asked, "...How is everything?"</p>

<p>"Very good, thank you," she responded. The waiter set the plates and drinks down and walked away with the manager following.</p>

<p>Samantha was poking at a chunk of chicken, and when Dave reached for the goblet she said urgently:</p>

<p>"Don't drink anything, Dave. It's poisoned."</p>

<p>Dave lowered the glass in a disconcerted way and turned to look towards the kitchen. The waiter and manager were at the kitchen entryway talking in hushed voices. "Poisoned?" he whispered to her.</p>

<p>"Apparently it's enough for the ambassador to know we're investigating," replied Samantha.</p>

<p>"What do we do?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"We've tried everything, Dave. There are no documents, no other sources, and no way of tricking anyone into talking. There's only one way to reveal the corruption," Samantha realized. "We need to go to the meeting tomorrow night and film it."</p>

<p>There was silence. Neither Dave nor Samantha were eating. Dave finally said, "We should just go and eat somewhere else."</p>

<p>The two got up and headed towards the front desk to pay. After Dave had paid the bill, he held the door open for Samantha and saw the manager looking at them sternly.</p>

<p>As they went through the doorway, Samantha turned and spoke to the manager in perfect Chinese, "Have a good day."</p>

<p>From outside of the restaurant, they could hear the manager yelling in Chinese, too indistinctly to be understood.</p><hr>

<p>During all this time, Geronimo had escaped from the TV station and had run off to the governor's mansion, in the hopes of meeting up with his humans. As he padded around the snowy mansion grounds, he let out a faint hiss.</p>

<p><em>Where are they...?</em></p>

<p>"Meow," a familiar voice mewed. Geronimo looked up to see, perched on a bare tree branch...Roxanne. "Hunting for something?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Searching for my humans," Geronimo replied.</p>

<p>"You just missed them," Roxanne told him, "They were here recently; they left after having a hissy fit with Victor."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>Roxanne leapt down from the tree. "Victor tried to pay them money to stop investigating. They hissed at him and then he hissed back and threw them out of his office."</p>

<p>"Damn, and I missed it!" Geronimo growled. "Do you know where they went?"</p>

<p>Roxanne lifted a paw and gestured for Geronimo to look across the street; Geronimo turned and saw a Channel 8 news van parked on the curb here, with Samantha and Dave seated inside.</p>

<p>"Thanks Roxy," purred Geronimo, and scampered off.</p>

<p>Inside the news van, Samantha and Dave were eating burgers that they had ordered. Geronimo leapt in through the open window and landed on Samantha's lap.</p>

<p>"Purrrrrr..." Geronimo sniffed at the burger that Samantha was eating.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, we told you to wait at the TV station," Samantha said.</p>

<p>"Cats gotta roam," Geronimo answered, and flipped over on her lap to look at her upside down. "Can I have some?" he asked, reaching towards the food with a paw. Samantha gave him a piece of beef.</p>

<p>"You know, it's been a while since I called Leandra," Samantha remarked to Dave. "It's been one thing after another...and now the manager of a restaurant tried to poison us..."</p>

<p>She said this very naturally, and it took a moment for Geronimo to realize what she had said.</p>

<p>"Wait...they tried to <em>poison</em> you?" Geronimo was flabbergasted.</p>

<p>"Apparently on orders of the Longguo ambassador," explained Samantha.</p>

<p>"Obviously they want to censor our reporting," Dave said.</p>

<p>"What kind of human is he, anyway?" Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>"A corrupt asshole," Samantha waved it off matter-of-factly. "Apparently they decided to act on the death threat Ulrich gave us."</p>

<p>"You received a <em>death threat</em>?" Geronimo was even more astounded.</p>

<p>Samantha didn't seem fazed at all. "Come on, let's get back to the newsroom. We still need to edit the interview footage."</p>

<p>As the news van drove off towards the television station, Geronimo couldn't keep from worrying that their investigative journalism was becoming a potentially lethal risk.</p><h3>Chapter 19 - Geronimo’s worry</h3>

<p>When Samantha and Dave arrived at the newsroom, Samantha sat down to adjust her report. Ever since they had first met Roxanne, she had been writing and revising a draft of the investigative story.</p>

<p>"It's starting to come together," Samantha remarked to Dave, who was standing behind her watching as she wrote the script. "We can put the clip of the warehouse meeting here."</p>

<p>"Presuming we get it," responded Dave. "There's still a chance they change their meeting place."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm concerned of," acknowledged Samantha. "The foxes are officially off the endangered list on midnight Friday. If we want to catch Ulrich at his corruption, this might be our last chance. He'll be able to dismiss anything we film after midnight as a legal business transaction. It might still be an interesting story, but there wouldn't be any proof Ulrich was involved in it beforehand or that he delisted the foxes to appease Ambassador Qiang."</p>

<p>"Hopefully Ted will let us stake out the warehouse," Dave said. "With so much going on with the election, he might want us somewhere else."</p>

<p>"That's true," Ted's voice broke in. They turned to see their editor watching them expectantly.</p>

<p>"Ted, we've finally got a lead in our investigation," Samantha told him. "I heard Ambassador Qiang say he was going to be at a warehouse office at 11 tonight. Our source told us they typically exchange the furs at night on Fridays, and we've heard a lot about a regional warehouse on Watt Street," continued Samantha. "We'd like to go to there and see who shows up and what they do."</p>

<p>"Everyone's supposed to show up there?" asked Ted.</p>

<p>"Everyone except Denise Ralston," responded Samantha.</p>

<p>"Samantha, all the polls are projecting Ulrich will be the election winner. We're going to do the usual continuous news broadcast starting from 11 o'clock onward as the votes are tallied up. We need everyone here at night to help with the news coverage," Ted said. "The Irving campaign is holding their election night rally at the Black Fox Casino, while Ulrich's is being held at the convention center. We need entire news teams at both locations to give live reports...and I want you two, plus two of the local reporters, covering Ulrich's party."</p>

<p>"This is our last chance," Samantha insisted.</p>

<p>"You've been following this story for over a month now," Ted pointed out. "Most of your leads have turned up cold. Are you sure there's even a verifiable story there?"</p>

<p>"Positive," Samantha replied. "That's why we've got to show up tonight."</p>

<p>"They have the corruption so well hidden, in order to bring it to light we'll need to film them in the act of trading the furs." added Dave. "If we get them on tape, we can report it."</p>

<p>There was a tense silence between them for a moment. The determination of both Samantha and Dave was evident, a sort of passionate energy to reveal the truth, and their editor understood it implicitly.</p>

<p>"Go for it." Ted said finally. "However, I still want you to cover Ulrich's election night rally. I expect you two there by 11:30 at least to give a report as the votes start coming in."</p>

<p>"All right," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"If you don't show up at the convention center," Ted told them, "and the candidates are giving their speeches and I haven't heard from you, I'll want to know why."</p>

<p>He sounded stern, but both Samantha and Dave knew their editor was concerned for them. What they were planning to do was risky, should they be caught.</p>

<p>"We'll show up," Samantha smiled.</p>

<p>The afternoon turned into evening and darkness fell over the city. Ted walked through the newsroom surveying the staff, who was there and who wasn't. He saw Samantha and Dave still at work at a desk. "It's getting late. You guys have been here since early today; go home and get some rest. You've got another long day tomorrow," he said to them.</p>

<p>"Ok Ted, thanks," answered Samantha.</p>

<p>Geronimo, meanwhile, had snuck away. All this time, he had been aimlessly exploring the newsroom, but at some point he escaped downstairs to the TV station's lobby. Here he waited until someone coming inside the building left the door partially open.</p>

<p>"Freedom!" he yowled, and bolted out the door before anyone had the chance to close it. He ran as fast as his legs could go. He felt free and was enjoying the run; until he reached the corner, turned...and almost bumped into Roxanne. Both cats screeched and jumped backwards trying to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>They both stood there in surprise until Geronimo finally said, "I had a wild kitty moment."</p>

<p>Roxanne answered back quickly, "You hit the nip, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," answered the tom, sheepishly.</p>

<p>Roxanne purred. "I decided to prowl over here because things are getting overly hectic at the mansion. You know how the elections are tomorrow night? Well, Victor's been practicing his speeches ad nauseum and conferring with his campaign manager and PR agents. They keep discussing something about how much confetti they should throw when he wins."</p>

<p>"Confetti is fun," Geronimo pointed out.</p>

<p>"It's the one highlight of having to attend the election night rally," Roxanne sighed. "Mabel and I have been to a bunch of events already, and they're predictable. Everyone knows he's going to win; his opponent can't catch up to him in the polls. Besides, the election night parties are always so noisy."</p>

<p>"Roxy," said Geronimo, "do you have anything to do tomorrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Not really. Why?"</p>

<p>"I was hoping you could drop by the cabin tomorrow early in the morning," meowed Geronimo. "I wanted to discuss something with you and the foxes Ivan and Natasha...about my humans' investigation."</p>

<p>"What about it?"</p>

<p>"They almost got killed earlier," Geronimo hissed.</p>

<p>Roxanne twitched her tail. "I was concerned about something like that."</p>

<p>"I've got to get them to stop this investigating," meowed Geronimo. "The whole thing seemed fun...to try and stop the poaching...but this is getting out of hand. The minute they start receiving death threats and attempts on their lives..."</p>

<p>"I can see what you mean," Roxanne considered, stretching. "Look, I'll drop by the cabin around sunrise. We can figure something out then, but I doubt your humans will approve."</p>

<p>"Either way, I've got to do something to protect them," Geronimo answered. "Thanks, Roxanne."</p>

<p>Around this time, Samantha and Dave walked out of the TV station. Roxanne mewed a greeting as she and Geronimo hurried towards them.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Geronimo, padding over with his tail held high.</p>

<p>"Heading back to the cabin," replied Dave.</p>

<p>"So no investigation stuff?" Geronimo questioned hopefully.</p>

<p>"Not until 11 p.m., anyway," Dave answered.</p>

<p>"We're going to ambush the gangsters tomorrow night, right in the middle of their meeting," Samantha announced.</p>

<p>"It's dangerous," Geronimo meowed. For the first time in his life, the tomcat had the distinct realization of his humans' mortality. "You might wind up getting shot...like almost happened a week ago when we saved Ivan and Natasha."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave exchanged a glance. "Ger, you know our profession was never the safest," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Can't you let someone else finish investigating?" he mewed.</p>

<p>Samantha squinted at him. "If everyone thought like that, no one would do the story. We have an obligation to our viewers to ensure the truth gets revealed. Somebody's got to take the risk and expose the corruption. If we don't, who will?"</p>

<p>Geronimo flattened his ears. "I don't see how it's worth risking your lives."</p>

<p>Samantha crouched down to where he was and stroked him on the head. "Geronimo, democracy lives by truth, and the free press is the guardian of that democracy. We swore to it; and we have a job to do...but I want you to be safe. Please...whatever happens...stay out of trouble."</p>

<p>Geronimo twitched his tail but didn't respond. He cast his gaze down at the sidewalk, towards his striped, grey paws.</p>

<p>Roxanne swished her tail. "I'll see you tomorrow, Geronimo," she meowed, and scampered off.</p><hr>

<p>Within an hour, the reporter and her cameraman arrived at the cabin where they were staying.</p>

<p>Later, Dave looked out the window of the bedroom. From the second floor, the forest was quite visible and the northern lights was putting on quite a show in the sky. Samantha was standing in front of a mirror, brushing her hair, and glanced over to him. Dave glanced back.</p>

<p>"These celestial lights really make me think about how complex our planet is," he said.</p>

<p>Samantha put the brush down and walked over to the window. "Yes," she answered, "Our planet is itself a living being and people must live in harmony with it."</p>

<p>Dave turned to her and they hugged each other. They stood there together, in each other’s arms, for a long time in silence, looking out at the aurora borealis display. Not much needed to be said between them. They loved each other and had loved each other for a very long time. They both knew the adventures and dangers that were part of their profession, and held a deep belief that every moment in life should be lived with passion and good memories, cherished.</p>

<p>Dave took Samantha's face in his hands and looked into her eyes. Her green eyes shone with the light that reflected from the night sky. He kissed her, and she kissed him back.</p>

<p>"I love you," they both said at the same time, and they laughed. He picked her up, carried her to the bed, and they kissed again, their warm bodies enveloping each other.</p>

<p>Outside, the night sky was alive with brilliant color; the northern lights swaying amidst the cold night air.</p><hr>

<p>At the Longguo Embassy, Ambassador Qiang Xue was on the telephone.</p>

<p>"My son, you're a clever scientist; your research is of tremendous importance. Do what the emperor tells you to do. There's a second call on the line. I will call you back." Qiang answered the other call. "...Yes?"</p>

<p>"Ambassador Qiang?" The restaurant manager's voice seemed tremulous. "I apologize for bothering you in your very important work... The two journalists are still alive. They did not drink the poisoned beverages..."</p>

<p>"You unreliable idiot!" Qiang was enraged. "Don't think you won't be punished for such lamentable stupidity!"</p>

<p>"No...please! I beg your forgiveness, most honorable ambassador! There was no way I could have known the lady spoke Chinese!"</p>

<p>Qiang thought about this briefly. "Very well," the diplomat at last said, seriously. "But bear in mind that I shall not tolerate any further mistakes."</p>

<p>When he hung up the telephone, he turned to one of his guards and said:</p>

<p>"The two journalists have not been silenced. See that the manager of the Hao Chi restaurant is silenced in their place. He failed in his assignment. Failure is inefficiency."</p><h3>Chapter 20 - Geronimo’s mission</h3>

<p>It was Friday, and election day. The sun was just beginning to filter through the pine trees that morning as Geronimo and the two foxes sat in the clearing outside of the cabin.</p>

<p>Geronimo proposed that this morning he, the two foxes, and Roxanne meet to discuss the matter of Samantha and Dave's investigation becoming dangerous. It was logical, since they all had a stake in it; Geronimo, however, did not tell Ivan or Natasha that Roxanne was the anonymous source, but rather that she was a friend of his and as the governor's house-pet she knew Ulrich would act on his threats. The foxes agreed that the issue was an important one.</p>

<p>The sound of rustling in the bushes made the critters alert. Roxanne emerged from the underbrush into the clearing.</p>

<p>"Hi everyone," she purred.</p>

<p>"Well, we're all here," meowed Geronimo, as he leapt onto the hood of the news van. "We may as well start the meeting."</p>

<p>"What exactly is this thing about your humans?" queried Natasha.</p>

<p>"As we know, Samantha and Dave are investigating the poaching," Geronimo began. "I'm worried about them. Just yesterday they got a death threat from Governor Ulrich. Then they were nearly poisoned at a restaurant."</p>

<p>"When Victor gives a threat like that, he intends to carry it out," Roxanne hissed. "Even more so if they don't back off of their investigating. Remember Ranger Conway? The only reason he didn't make another attempt on his life, is because Conway decided to give up."</p>

<p>"Samantha and Dave are dedicated to their jobs," Geronimo explained, "so dedicated that they seem willing to put themselves in harm's way for it."</p>

<p>"I see where this is going," Ivan said.</p>

<p>"Exactly," hissed Geronimo. "Tonight they're planning to ambush Ulrich and the poaching ring at a meeting they're having over at that regional warehouse."</p>

<p>"That's like suicide if they get caught," observed Natasha.</p>

<p>Geronimo nodded. "I can't let my humans put themselves in any more danger."</p>

<p>"You're right about that," Ivan agreed. "We can't let the feeders get shot."</p>

<p>"Yeah...and more than just being feeders, to me they're family," Geronimo added. "I know how important stopping the poachers are, but it might end up killing my humans."</p>

<p>"Unless we convince your humans about how serious this is getting," reasoned Roxanne. "I don't like Victor, and I'd like to see him get punished...but not at the expense of anyone's life."</p>

<p>"So what's the plan?" barked Ivan.</p><hr>

<p>An hour or so later, Geronimo flexed his claws as he watched Samantha type the number 30 at the end of her script. She was writing up a news report on the pre-election polls. According to the polls, Ulrich would win by a landslide. Geronimo was only half paying attention to what his human was writing, however. He was reviewing the plan he and the other critters had come up with that morning to stop Samantha and Dave from getting in harm's way.</p>

<p><em>There's nothing we can do until later, though,</em> Geronimo thought, and turned his attention elsewhere. He began observing everyone in the newsroom. He knew it was election day, and the newsroom would be in its usual flurry of activity by nighttime as the votes were counted, but at the moment there was little activity. Other than the surprise of hearing that the manager of the Chinese restaurant had been shot to death earlier in the morning - another reporter had been sent out to cover that - not much else had been happening besides the routine reports on the pre-election polls. Most everyone was sitting around, either typing scripts or editing video.</p>

<p>"Looks like it's a slow news day today," observed Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" Samantha chided. "It's a journalist superstition. It means a huge story will break and we'll have to spend overnight covering it."</p>

<p>"Oh." Geronimo licked a paw.</p>

<p>"We've already got the election coverage all night," Dave, who had walked over to Samantha, shrugged. He was carrying two mugs of coffee emblazoned with the network's logo; he handed one to Samantha. "It's just stating the obvious."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Samantha with squinted green eyes as she grasped the coffee mug with both hands and sat back in her chair. "But I don't want to take any chances of us getting called off on another story, with our stake-out planned for tonight."</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed with nothing eventful, and when nighttime came Samantha and Dave went to give a live report from outside one of the polling places, announcing the close of the voting period.</p>

<p>"Can't I come?" Geronimo meowed as they were waiting for the elevator heading down. "<em>Purrrrr</em>lease?"</p>

<p>"No, Ger," Dave replied. "We're heading from there to the warehouse. It's too dangerous for you to tag along."</p>

<p>"Stay here at the TV station," Samantha told Geronimo. "If all goes well, we should be back by 1."</p>

<p>"If all goes well," the tomcat pointed out.</p>

<p>"Don't be pessimistic, Geronimo," Samantha smiled, trying to cheer him up. "We'll be back before you know it."</p>

<p>Geronimo said nothing as the elevator doors opened and his humans stepped inside.</p>

<p>When the doors had closed, the cat scampered away. He ran down the hallway outside of the newsroom until he reached a small window. The Siamese-mix tomcat leapt up, pushed the window pane open and escaped onto a section of the roof, judiciously closing the window behind him with a paw.</p><hr>

<p>At the governor's mansion, Ulrich was in his office organizing some papers on his desk. As he stood up and headed toward the open door, Denise walked in.</p>

<p>"Have you got the envelope?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, here," she answered, handing it to him.</p>

<p>Ulrich opened the manila business-sized envelope and counted the bills quickly. He took some dollars out of the batch and handed them back to Denise, "Take these, and put them back," he said.</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked Denise, waving the money. "A tip for me?" she asked half-jokingly.</p>

<p>"Like hell," answered Ulrich. "Those morons haven't been bringing in enough fur pelts and I'm docking their pay."</p>

<p>"Bad idea Victor. They might decide to blackmail us," she said.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask for your opinion, bitch. And what do you mean <em>us</em>? This isn't your racket," he responded.</p>

<p>Denise was visibly angry and yelled at him, "Without me, you couldn't get this business arrangement going. I'm not getting grabbed by the authorities just because you don’t want to pay those idiots you hired!"</p>

<p>Ulrich slapped her hard across the face and grabbed her by the hair, "Listen, bitch. I'm the boss, yesterday, today and tomorrow. Remember that." He released her and went out the door.</p>

<p>Denise put her hand to her cheek and with an intense look of hatred, said to herself, "We'll see about that, Governor."</p>

<p>Outside, Ulrich was getting into his car and the chauffeur walked over to greet him. "Sir, I was on my way home, but if you need me to drive you somewhere..."</p>

<p>Ulrich interrupted him. "No," he said abruptly, and got into his car and drove off.</p><hr>

<p>When Ulrich arrived at the warehouse, he noticed that the ambassador's limousine was already there. "Fuck," he said to himself. "I hate it when he gets here before I do."</p>

<p>Close by, the WCAT Channel 8 news van was pulling up to the curb. From inside the vehicle, Samantha and Dave could see the governor get out of his car and lock it.</p>

<p>"I hope this goes well," Dave remarked. "If we get spotted, we're history."</p>

<p>"We've got no choice, Dave," replied Samantha. "We'll just have to sneak close enough to get the shot of them with the furs, and then sneak away before they realize we're there. Where's my microphone?"</p>

<p>Dave turned toward the back of the news van, and then muttered, "Oh, great."</p>

<p>Samantha looked over to see four determined critters sitting in the back of the news van. "Geronimo!" exclaimed Samantha.</p>

<p>"...and friends," purred Roxanne. Geronimo had both front paws on the microphone bag, while Ivan, Natasha and Roxanne were clustered around the camera bag.</p>

<p>"We're here to stop you from putting yourself in unnecessary danger yet again," announced Geronimo.</p>

<p>"We don't have enough time for this," said Samantha. "If we don't get over there now, we'll miss getting them on camera."</p>

<p>"But Samantha...!" Geronimo yowled.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, this is something we have to do." Samantha told him. "You'll understand why, some day."</p>

<p>She tugged the microphone bag loose from his claws and quickly retrieved the microphone from inside. The foxes yapped and Roxanne hissed, but the photographer also got the camera out of the other bag. Samantha and Dave jumped out of the news van, closing the doors behind them, and hurried to connect the microphone cable to the camera before racing off towards the warehouse. Geronimo leapt to the dashboard and watched his humans run off.</p>

<p>"We tried," barked Natasha.</p>

<p>Hiding near the warehouse, Samantha and Dave were immersed in filming the governor as he entered the storage building. The TV news crew snuck closer to the door, where they could barely overhear voices inside the building, fading into the back. The news reporter motioned to her cameraman to come around the side of the building, where they carefully stepped through the icy remainder of the snow. This entire side of the building was windowless, except for a lone window surrounded by overgrown holly bushes. "What if they changed their exchange place to deep inside the building, where we have no way of seeing?" Dave whispered to Samantha as they approached the window.</p>

<p>At that moment a light came on in the window; Samantha and her companion pressed themselves closer to the wall. They heard the Longguo ambassador speaking and as Samantha held the microphone near the window, Dave began filming the scene inside. "I must admit after you cancelled our meeting, I was beginning to doubt whether you were still interested in business."</p>

<p>"Would I really shirk profit?" said a voice that sounded like the governor's.</p>

<p>"Speaking of profit," a clearly annoyed Gorgonio spoke up, "you haven't given us our part of the money for hunting those foxes last week."</p>

<p>Ulrich glared at Gorgonio. "You'll <em>get</em> your half. Bring the merchandise."</p>

<p>Gorgonio turned his gaze to Theron and Venancio, who were standing on the side; both left to get the crates of furs.</p>

<p>From what Samantha and Dave could see from the window, those present were Ambassador Qiang and two of his bodyguards, Governor Ulrich, and Gorgonio; apart from Theron and Venancio, who brought in first one, then two wood crates. They placed them atop the table in the center of the room and opened one, revealing numerous arctic fox pelts. They seemed to gleam white in the dim illumination of the warehouse. Qiang examined the furs and, apparently satisfied, placed his suitcase on the table and opened it. Inside were rows and batches of cash, clearly visible from the window.</p>

<p>"Payment includes that for other crate," said Qiang.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Ulrich, taking the suitcase. He shook Qiang's hand. "Nice doing business with you."</p>

<p>"As always," said Qiang. "You are now leaving to the election night party?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Ulrich. "We're ahead in the polls. It should be a landslide victory."</p>

<p>"Your country is so inefficient, with its periodic elections," said Qiang dismissively. "In Longguo we appoint officials as needed. No use catering to the dumb masses."</p>

<p>Gorgonio, who had his arms crossed and was leaning against the wall in annoyance, impatiently said, "And <em>now</em>..."</p>

<p>Ulrich half-threw a bulky manila envelope at him, which Gorgonio caught easily and proceeded to count the bills inside. At that moment, Denise Ralston walked through the door, dressed for the election party in a sparkling, midnight-blue evening gown. She was wearing the arctic fox stole.</p>

<p>Qiang glanced over at her, visibly angry. "Why is she here?"</p>

<p>Ulrich seemed surprised as well. "What the hell are you doing here?!" he snapped at her. "You're never to show up at these meetings!"</p>

<p>"Oh really?" she scoffed. "I'm the one laundering the money and embezzling it out of the regional funds to pay these poachers of yours. And you don't think I have the right to drop in?"</p>

<p>"What the hell is this?" Gorgonio suddenly broke in, showing Ulrich the envelope furiously. "This is for one crate of furs, not two! You owe us money for poaching those damned foxes! Not to mention for that job shutting up the wildlife minister that I did a month ago!"</p>

<p>Theron looked taken aback, and the words escaped him from astonishment: "...<em>you</em> tried to kill Washburn?!"</p>

<p>"...and a fine job you did of it," Ulrich snarled, ignoring Theron, "since Washburn's alive and talking!"</p>

<p>"I made him sign those papers you wanted to take the foxes off of the endangered list," Gorgonio retorted. "It's not my fault those reporters showed up."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> your fault that you didn't make sure he was dead!" Ulrich countered. "It's a wonder you're even able to hunt foxes being so inefficient. Or are they already dead of starvation by the time you remember to check your traps?"</p>

<p>"The pot calling the kettle black," sneered Gorgonio. "If you weren't so full of yourself maybe you'd remember that people don't work for you for free!"</p>

<p>The governor whipped out a revolver he had hidden inside his coat and aimed it at Gorgonio. "<em>What</em> did you say...?"</p>

<p>Gorgonio raised his hands disarmingly and took a step back. "Nothing."</p>

<p>"Sam, we'd better get out of here," Dave, outside, whispered to Samantha.</p>

<p>Samantha had not taken her eyes off the unfolding scene inside the building, but at Dave's words, she stepped back to leave.</p>

<p>She was suddenly taken off balance as her heel caught on the microphone wire. Dave tried to catch hold of her but she fell backwards into the holly bush with a gasp.</p>

<p>The loud crash of the leaves made everyone inside look unanimously in their direction; Samantha and Dave froze.</p>

<p>There was silence for a lingering moment. "Run for it!" Samantha shouted to Dave.</p>

<p>The television crew made a dash for the news van as Ulrich gestured with the revolver for the poachers to go after them.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave leapt in and, slamming the doors shut, put the van sharply into reverse. The tires screeched as the vehicle pulled back. Geronimo and Roxanne let out a caterwaul as inertia forced them about, while Ivan and Natasha scrambled for a hold on something.</p>

<p>Gorgonio sprang out of the building, lifting his rifle and firing two or three shots at them, when without warning Ulrich arrived. He pushed the rifle's muzzle down to point at the asphalt ground. "No, you fool! Don't kill them!"</p>

<p>"What the..." Gorgonio protested.</p>

<p>"The photographer was recording," said Ulrich. "I want that videotape and I want to know who tipped them off!"</p>

<p>With a disenchanted smirk, Gorgonio again fell in pursuit.</p>

<p>The TV news van halted suddenly as the diplomat's car blocked their escape route. Dave shifted gears and hit the acceleration pedal; the van sped forward. From the back of the van, Geronimo let out a hiss.</p>

<p>Samantha hurriedly took the TV camera from where it was placed beside Dave. "We've got to save the tape, Dave," she said.</p>

<p>"Hide it in the back somewhere," Dave told her.</p>

<p>She shut off the camera and ejected the videocassette as the hunters' pick-up blocked their second exit. Their speeding TV news van was now trapped between two cars and an imminent crash with the warehouse's brick wall.</p>

<p>With a sudden movement, Dave hit the brake; the news van skidded sideways and the reporter and her cameraman were thrown forward in their seats.</p>

<p>This was enough time for the poachers to arrive and rush over. Gorgonio pulled open the unlocked door and he and Venancio forced Dave out, while Samantha ducked into the back of the news van with the camera.</p>

<p>Samantha placed the camera on the table before the broadcasting equipment and looked around for a place to hide the videotape. Turning at the sound of a meow, she saw Geronimo and Roxanne. They had hidden underneath the driver's seat, where they could cling to it with their claws and avoid being thrown about the automobile; both cats had wide black eyes. The two foxes were under the passenger seat, their bushy tails swishing from side to side.</p>

<p>"Take this to the TV station, Geronimo," Samantha whispered, pushing the tape under the driver's seat before the cats could respond. "Whatever you do, <em>don't come back</em>."</p>

<p>"But..." Geronimo protested.</p>

<p>"<em>Don't come back</em>," Samantha reiterated. She turned back to the camera, seizing a blank tape that was on the rack here and loading it into the camera just as Gorgonio appeared inside the news van.</p>

<p>The lead hunter aimed his rifle at her. "Hand me the camera, or else you won't be <em>alive</em> at five."</p>

<p>He underestimated Samantha.</p>

<p>She placed one hand on the camera's handle but as he got closer, she grabbed a folded tripod with her other hand and hit him over the head. He let out a surprised cry and doubled over with pain.</p>

<p>"This just in, you son of a bitch," Samantha snapped and tried to push her way past him with the camera. Gorgonio grabbed her arm and when she spun around, he pushed her back against the broadcasting equipment and the antenna lever, the latter of which was thrust upwards from the impact. He seized her as she fought to get loose; her jacket was pulled off in the process.</p>

<p>Freeing herself, she tried to make her way past the two front seats again, this time managing to get outside before a blow from behind caught her off guard, and she shrieked, seizing her leg at the hip. Gorgonio had hit her with the rifle.</p>

<p>Geronimo nearly leapt out of his hiding place at the sound of his human's cry. "Let me at him!"</p>

<p>"No, Geronimo!" Roxanne hissed, biting down on his collar to pull him back. "He'll kill you!"</p>

<p>Gorgonio forced the camera away from the injured Samantha, and then hurled her cruelly against the side of the news van. She gasped as she fell to the asphalt.</p>

<p>Gorgonio handed the camera to Ulrich, who had approached along with Qiang and Denise.</p>

<p>Ulrich ejected the videocassette, tossing the camera carelessly to the ground and, as Samantha watched, he tore the film out of the cassette, pulled a lighter out of his pocket and set the film ablaze. He threw this on the ground too, and then roughly pulled Samantha to her feet.</p>

<p>Samantha stared rather forlornly at the remnants of the film smoldering on the asphalt. It occurred to her how close they had come to destroying the actual tape they had recorded and not just a blank one. It also occurred to her that she and Dave were likely going to be killed now that the evidence had supposedly been dealt with. <em>Where is Dave?</em> She couldn't see him anywhere.</p>

<p>Ulrich's gaze was cold. "All right, Samantha," he snarled, "I said to drop the poaching story, but you were set on having your exclusive. You're going to get more than a story now."</p>

<p>"Haste may lead to later ill." It was Ambassador Qiang. "An ancient rule states: You do not just kill your enemy, but the one who warned your enemy."</p>

<p>"Meaning, her anonymous source within the governor's mansion," said Ulrich, as Samantha struggled to get her arm loose from his grip.</p>

<p>"Who else would have told her so much about our business?" asked Qiang. "...or told her where we were meeting?"</p>

<p>"You told me where the meeting was yourself, Ambassador Qiang," replied Samantha in perfect Chinese.</p>

<p>Qiang was momentarily in shock. "Perhaps I did make the error of speaking in front of you at the embassy, and you learned of the warehouse meeting by overhearing me. However, I did not tell you that Longguo was involved. You would not have come to the embassy to begin with without someone having told you that."</p>

<p>"...and how about you damn reporters showing up at the hunting cabin?" interjected Gorgonio. "Our address wasn't exactly common knowledge."</p>

<p>"You're going to name your source," the governor told the news reporter.</p>

<p>"Not happening," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"I don't think you realize what kind of a situation you've gotten yourself into," countered Ulrich.</p>

<p>"I have a pretty good idea," she replied. "Either way, my anonymous source is staying anonymous."</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't reveal your sources," Ulrich smiled sarcastically. "Isn't that cute. The intrepid reporter, bound by her profession's ethics. Do you think that your source would remain silent if they were in your situation? I'll ask once more, <em>nicely.</em>" Suddenly, the governor seized her by the nape of the neck, shaking her so harshly that she had to suppress a gasp. "Name your source, Samantha West! Name him or we'll <em>make</em> you!"</p>

<p>"Go to hell, you fascist son of a bitch!" she retorted.</p>

<p>Ulrich fixed his gaze on her, and Qiang broke in:</p>

<p>"Perhaps our young newswoman needs a bit more persuasion."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Ulrich, turning back to Samantha.</p>

<p>"...and when I can't be 'persuaded'?" answered Samantha fearlessly.</p>

<p>"You will be," Ulrich responded dryly, and threw her violently to the side.</p>

<p>When she fell against the hood of the news van, she noticed something motionless on the ground. With a plummeting feeling, she realized it was her cameraman. His eyes were closed, and he didn't stir.</p>

<p>"Dave!" Samantha screamed out his name, devastated. "What have you done to Dave!?"</p>

<p>Everything happened so fast, Samantha didn't have a chance to react. Gorgonio had retrieved the glass vial of chloroform, poured some of the anesthetic on a handkerchief and grabbed her from the back. As he clapped the handkerchief over her nose and mouth, almost smothering her with it, she realized what he was doing and struggled helplessly to release herself from him. Yet what seemed even harder to Samantha, was not breathing in. It was an enticing scent; a soft, sugary-sweet fragrance that was mysteriously out of reach, tempting to inspire. Dizziness and drowsiness began to take hold of her, as first hearing and then vision began to fade, and at last she passed out, overpowered within moments by the quick sleep of the chloroform...</p>

<p>The others watched as her eyes closed and she went limp in the poacher's arms.</p>

<p>Ambassador Qiang reached down and picked up the reporter's press ID card. It had fallen on the ground from where it had been clipped to her skirt. "We must move fast. Take them into the building," the diplomat demanded.</p>

<p>The governor turned his attention to the hunters and ordered, "Hurry up, before that drug wears off."</p>

<p>"I <em>told</em> you that TV reporter would cause trouble," Denise irately told Ulrich.</p>

<p>Ulrich ignored her statement. "It's getting late. We ought to get to that election-night rally if we hope to preserve our image. Of all the times those stupid journalists had to show up, it had to have been <em>tonight</em>!"</p>

<p>"I can easily dispose of them," Gorgonio offered.</p>

<p>"No," Ulrich ordered him, "Then we'll never get the information we want. We'll be a couple of hours at the rally, so stay here with them until we get back. Don't kill them. And <em>don't</em>..." he added when a smirk crossed Gorgonio's face, "...do anything drastic."</p>

<p>"That takes all the fun out of this," Gorgonio complained. "Don't you want us to get them to talk?"</p>

<p>"I'll do that myself," Ulrich responded through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>As they dispersed, Ambassador Qiang studied Samantha's press card, along with Dave's, which he had also taken. Without saying anything, he put them in his coat pocket and left.</p>

<p>Inside the news van, the critters were still huddled under the seats, their eyes wide. Geronimo was looking down, despondently, at the videotape.</p>

<p><em>She's trusting us to get this to the station,</em> he thought. With the fur rising along his back, Geronimo was suddenly struck with the painful awareness that the tape he had before him might very well be Samantha and Dave's final report.</p><h3>Chapter 21 - Election Night</h3>

<p>The darkness of the forest was mitigated only by the green glow of the northern lights above, which reached down through the pine branches to be reflected by the cold, melting snow. Geronimo, Roxanne, Ivan and Natasha were all somber as they trudged through the woods. They had crept out of the news van when they heard silence outside and, fearing being sighted, went into the forest. It was a detour from the direct city path to the WCAT television station, but the only sure-fire way they knew to safeguard the film which had been entrusted to them.</p>

<p>Geronimo held the videotape. The cassette was of a small, portable type that was not much bigger than the palm of one's hand, but for a cat, transporting it was an effort. After a while the jaws began to ache and breathing became hard. Seeing the struggle, Ivan offered to carry it at some point, and Geronimo relented and let the fox take it.</p>

<p>At last they reached a small clearing, with a slope overlooking the tundra, and a clear view of the aurora above. They stopped here for a rest. The world seemed noiseless, without even the singing of birds. Geronimo fluffed his fur against the cold, which had grown sharper since they had set out.</p>

<p>"What Ulrich said was true," Roxanne's voice broke the silence. "Nortenya is his, soon all of Sarrilla will be, and no one can stop him."</p>

<p>"Well, your humans were kind to try to help us," Ivan sighed. "They ended up giving their lives for it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Geronimo," said Natasha, nudging the tomcat with her muzzle.</p>

<p>"I don't understand." Geronimo kept reviewing the scene in his mind. "Why would they put themselves in that danger? Why? They knew going there to film was dangerous."</p>

<p>"Journalists do stuff like that," replied Roxanne. "I heard a bunch of them are jailed in other countries."</p>

<p>Pawsteps made the critters alert. They looked towards the bushes to see Zachary, the park ranger's Husky dog.</p>

<p>"Zachary!" meowed Geronimo.</p>

<p>"I went out for a walk," he said. "I couldn't help but overhear...the news-people...your humans...?"</p>

<p>"They've been kidnapped," Geronimo sighed.</p>

<p>Zachary's head drooped. "...I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"They left us this tape," Geronimo continued. "It was Samantha and Dave's last request that it be taken to the TV station."</p>

<p>"The WCAT TV station? That's a long way off."</p>

<p>"We can't even go directly," added Natasha. "You know the regional warehouse on the outskirts of the city? That's where they were grabbed, so we've had to loop around through the woods to avoid being seen."</p>

<p>"If I carry the tape and run, I can probably get there faster than you could," barked Zachary.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Zach," said Geronimo, his eyes glistening with emotion.</p>

<p>The canine grabbed the videocassette and with a muffled woof, ran off into the woods.</p>

<p>"I'm going back to save my humans," Geronimo announced when Zachary had left.</p>

<p>"You're going to <em>what</em>?" Roxanne mewed.</p>

<p>"My humans have been good to me," Geronimo meowed. "I can't let them die without even trying to rescue them."</p>

<p>Ivan thought for a moment. "It's because of them, startling the hunter, that we're still alive. We owe them our lives," he said. "All right," he added, "I'm in."</p>

<p>"I'm in too," Natasha agreed. "It'll be a way to get back at those evil people for all the harm they've done to us foxes."</p>

<p>Roxanne hissed. "You're acting like lemmings."</p>

<p>"Roxanne..." began Geronimo.</p>

<p>"Geronimo, think about how ludicrous this is!" she hissed. "Two cats and two foxes going up against <em>several armed men</em>. And after how long dragging the tape here took us...I'm sorry, but your humans have probably been killed by now."</p>

<p>"They haven't," Geronimo meowed. "I sense that they're still alive. But if we don't do something fast, they will be."</p>

<p>"Geronimo," she said, "it's not worth risking your own life. Let someone else do it."</p>

<p>"If we don't, who will?" questioned the tomcat.</p>

<p>All the critters were speechless for a moment. "I think I get why they did it now," Geronimo said at last. "It was their job, kind of like our job as cats is to attack rats even though they can attack us back."</p>

<p>"What do rats have to do with this?" prompted Roxanne.</p>

<p>"We attack rats because it's for the common good. Rats harbor diseases," explained Geronimo. "This poaching problem was something that had to be dealt with for the common good. Someone had to take the risk, because if no one did the corruption would just keep getting worse and worse until all of Sarrilla <em>would</em> be under Ulrich's power, and then it wouldn't be foxes alone in trouble. Even the other humans would be. There would be no freedom for anybody..."</p>

<p>"That doesn't apply here," interrupted Roxanne. "Someone else can do this. The police, maybe."</p>

<p>"I thought the police chief was one of the people Ulrich was paying," pointed out Ivan. Roxanne gave a frustrated hiss.</p>

<p>"You're missing the point. You're going to end up getting killed."</p>

<p>"Not if we play our cards right," Geronimo meowed. "Roxy, we need your help to get inside without being seen. You know the inside layout of the warehouse."</p>

<p>"I saw a map of it once, that Denise had," Roxanne answered. "That building is a maze!"</p>

<p>"But you'd know how to sneak in!" Geronimo persisted.</p>

<p>"Hypothetically, yes," said Roxanne, flattening her ears. "Practically, I want no part in this."</p>

<p>"But Roxy..." Geronimo's mew went ignored as Roxanne bounded away.</p>

<p>Geronimo chased after her a short distance, until they were out of hearing range of the two foxes. Roxanne turned around to face Geronimo, her back arched.</p>

<p>"I'm heading to the election night party to hear that asshole Victor's acceptance speech. Mabel is probably concerned that it's late and I'm not there. I'm sorry about your humans, really...but we can't do anything for them anymore."</p>

<p>"All right Roxanne," Geronimo hissed. "If I can't convince you, I can't convince you. But realize my humans will probably die to protect your identity. The least you could do is help me, help them."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned and ran back to the foxes, leaving Roxanne gazing up at the northern lights, thinking.</p><hr>

<p>While Zachary ran towards the city, Geronimo and the two foxes returned to the storage place. As they raced through the forest the only sound was the rustle of their paws through the snow and bracken. Their lithe forms were outlined against the pine trees, their breath visible in clouds of mist. Far into the city, WCAT news editor Ted Hughes was watching the various clocks on the newsroom wall. They displayed the hour in different time zones worldwide, with their time zone in the center. It was almost midnight, and the entire newsroom was a flurry of activity for their election-night broadcast. Ulrich had won a second term. His election to parliament next election cycle was assured, the political analysts and commentators all said, and his name was among those being spoken of as potential candidates for the prime minister's office in a few years. His popularity was outstanding, and a correlation was made between it and his having seemingly helped the arctic fox recover.</p>

<p>Yet Ted was becoming increasingly worried about the whereabouts of Samantha and Dave. "We'll lead the next block with the governor's rally and then his opponent's one, before we flip to the round table commentators," Ted was saying as he handed papers to a producer, who hurried off to the news studio. Ted glanced again at the clocks on the wall.</p>

<p>"...Where are Samantha and Dave?" he muttered to himself. "They should have called in hours ago!"</p>

<p>"Still no word from your reporters?" asked Devon, who had walked over from the studio.</p>

<p>"I'm worried what could be wrong," Ted answered.</p>

<p>"Maybe they forgot to call in," Devon considered.</p>

<p>"No," said Ted, "they're not like that."</p>

<p>As if on cue, Devon's secretary called from his office, "Mr. Gao, telephone."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Devon replied as he walked over to the desk and picked up the telephone receiver. "Hello? ...speak up, I can hardly hear you."</p>

<p>"Devon, it's Todd. I'm at the rally." The reporter on the other line was speaking over a background of zealous chants <em>"Governor Ulrich! Integrity and Humanity!"</em></p>

<p>"And...?" asked the news editor.</p>

<p>"Samantha and Dave aren't here. They haven't called us, either. Are they at the station?"</p>

<p>"What? No, they aren't here. I haven't heard from them since..." Devon's voice trailed off.</p>

<p>At that point, Ted walked over and said, “Devon, let me talk to Todd.”</p>

<p>Devon handed the phone receiver to him, and Ted spoke quickly. “Todd, are Samantha and Dave there?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t heard from them, and the governor's about to speak,” added Todd.</p>

<p>Ted thought for a moment and recalled that the pair were last heading to investigate the rendezvous between the governor and the fox poachers. "They should still be at their last assignment," he said. There was silence. “Todd, go ahead with the broadcast. Call in if they show up,” the editor said, and hung up the phone.</p>

<p>He looked over at Devon, and the solemn look on his face said what they were both thinking. They both knew what Samantha and Dave had been investigating and what the disappearance of a reporter on that sort of story usually meant.</p>

<p>At the Longguo Embassy, the glittering black limousine with the Longguo flags, pulled up to the front of the building. Moments later, the distinguished ambassador would enter his office and toss the press cards on his desk; atop sprawled embassy paperwork professing only peaceful relations between the governments of Longguo and Sarrilla. Governor Ulrich, meanwhile, was stepping onto the stage at the election-night rally, to the glorifying cheers of the crowd. Not a single person could suspect the admired governor, the winner of the election; or his treasurer Denise Ralston, who sat at a table directly before the stage, the fox stole wrapped about her shoulders as she sipped champagne. The picture of high society, the darlings of good family, and the lead criminals of the poaching ring.</p>

<p>All this was unseen by the critters, who knew only the desperation they felt to reach Samantha and Dave...and the sense that although the journalists were still alive, somehow they would be too late.</p><h3>Chapter 22 - Inquisitor’s First Degree</h3>

<p>Darkness, total darkness. As the chloroform began to wear off, Samantha West began to gradually come out of the stupor she had been cast into. It felt like floating in nothingness. She could faintly hear people's voices around her, the sounds of talking in the background, and as she blearily opened her eyes, she felt a terrible pressure about her head. There was still a dull pain where she had been struck on the hip, but it was subsiding. The room she was in was dimly lit and shadowy; a very small room, enclosed tightly by metallic divisions - one of the warehouse storage units, she quickly discerned - and a red brick wall towards her back, the latter of which she could barely see out of the corner of her eye. The outskirts of the room were hidden by shadows, as the only light came from an ominously buzzing low-wattage lightbulb hung overhead from the ceiling's rusty wire mesh, and filtered in sporadically from the flickering fluorescent lights in the corridor. This only dimly illuminated the windowless room.</p>

<p>"Samantha! ...Samantha!" It was Dave's voice. She looked over and saw her photographer, seated a small distance to her left. He had a bruise on the side of his face, as if he had been punched; he was more worried about her, however.</p>

<p>"Dave...?" she said drowsily. "You're alive."</p>

<p>"They knocked us out, it seems, with chloroform," answered Dave.</p>

<p>Samantha was groggy, yet she recognized a voice in the distance and when Gorgonio stood in front of her, she nearly jumped in surprise, discovering in consequence that she was held down in some fashion. As her vision began to regain itself, she saw that she was sitting in an antique oaken chair; her wrists had been tied with rope to the armrests, her ankles were also bound, and she was restrained to the back of the chair with an encircling rope about her upper arms and middle. She soon realized Dave was in the same predicament, and seated in a similar chair. To her right, much closer than Dave, was a heavy oak wood table that appeared to be the match of the chairs; this was entirely bare except for the empty glass bottle of chloroform. There was a small stack of cardboard boxes in one corner of the room, but not much else.</p>

<p>Samantha began tugging vehemently against the ropes, and Gorgonio dismissively gestured to them. "Don't bother trying to break free - you can't. For that matter, calling for help is useless. The walls are so thick you wouldn't be able to tell if there was a storm outside."</p>

<p>Samantha's green eyes flashed defiantly at him, and he continued with a smirk, "Now that our enterprising little TV news crew is awake from the chloroform, we can get on with this. Samantha West, you and your coworker are powerless. If you want to live, you'll do what we want."</p>

<p>"I can't reveal my sources," said Samantha simply.</p>

<p>"Don't give me that bullshit; you can and you will," Gorgonio snapped. "After all, your camera guy here works behind the scenes. You have to stand in front of 8 million viewers. I wonder how long it would take you to get back on the air if you refuse to cooperate."</p>

<p>"Is that how that happened to Dave?" Samantha's green eyes seethed with anger.</p>

<p>"No, that was for the fun of it," Gorgonio sneered. "It's obvious you're the only one who knows the source; you're the reporter, after all."</p>

<p>He grabbed her by the collar of her blouse, and Dave spoke up, "We're a team. I know who the source is, just as she does."</p>

<p>"Really?" Gorgonio demanded. "Name the snitch then."</p>

<p>"We...can't." Dave replied, his eyes briefly meeting with Samantha's. "It's against our professional ethics."</p>

<p>The words sounded small, and Gorgonio seemed to find them amusing. He released Samantha's collar. "Wait until Ulrich gets back," he told them maliciously, "then we'll see whether your ethics mean more to you than your lives."</p><hr>

<p><em>How much time had elapsed?</em> Samantha's thoughts seemed to return infallibly to this. There was no window in the dark storage unit, no clock, no way of knowing if they had been there for minutes or hours. There was only her growing sleepiness which hinted at the lateness, yet she had not even the slightest perception of how long she had been unconscious from the chloroform to begin with. She might have asked Dave about this; however, there always seemed to be at least two of the hunters in the room with them at any given moment.</p>

<p>They were presently in the room with Gorgonio and Theron. Theron was standing at the doorway, a mixture of boredom and discontent reflected on his face. Gorgonio stood to the side, leaning against one of the metallic walls that divided the storage units. Once or twice, he spun the cylinder of a revolver he held in an idle manner, showing off the fact that he was passing time waiting for the governor. Neither one had spoken to the hostages since the exchange of words when they had come to. Dave fidgeted uncomfortably in his seat but stayed quiet, while Samantha had been tugging again at the ropes; somewhat weary from these unsuccessful efforts, she turned her attention to their captors.</p>

<p>"You know what strikes me as odd?" she said.</p>

<p>Gorgonio glared at her, and she went on without caring, "How you ever got hired by the governor. How'd you get the clout?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," he responded.</p>

<p>"Do you honestly think you'll get away with this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came Gorgonio's answer.</p>

<p>"That's because you're an idiot," Samantha replied. "We're journalists. We were investigating a news story. Can you imagine the headlines if we turn up dead?"</p>

<p>"You <em>will</em> if you don't shut the fuck up!" Gorgonio shouted at her.</p>

<p>"Sam, don't antagonize them," Dave whispered to her.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she answered her photographer in a louder voice. "They're going to kill us either way."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but we don't have to rush them," Dave answered.</p>

<p>"All right," Gorgonio interjected, snapping the cylinder back into place and walking over to Samantha. "You want to talk? Then talk." He grabbed Samantha by her hair, and held the gun to the side of her head. "If you don't tell me who your source is by the time I count down to one, you're dead."</p>

<p>"You think that'll make me tell you?"</p>

<p>"Ten..." he began counting, "nine...eight...seven..."</p>

<p>Although Samantha couldn't see Dave, she could sense his tension; letting out a small sigh, she focused her attention on the wall in the corridor, beyond a visibly surprised Theron, and tried to relax. The muzzle of the gun felt astonishingly cold against her skin.</p>

<p>"...six...five...four...three..." - Samantha heard a sharp <em>click</em> - "two...any last words?"</p>

<p>"None," Samantha said, feigning indifference.</p>

<p>"One," said Gorgonio.</p>

<p>There was a pause that seemed to last centuries, when at last the trigger was pulled. There was only another click.</p>

<p>"Well," Gorgonio said bemusedly, as he released her, "will you look at that! Talk about a cheap game of Russian roulette. I forgot to load it with bullets!"</p>

<p>Samantha gave him an irritated look from narrowed green eyes; Dave, whose nerves appeared shattered from what had occurred, snapped at him, "Leave her alone, you rat."</p>

<p>"If you care so much about your little girlfriend," Gorgonio answered, "then why don't <em>you</em> tell us what we want to know?"</p>

<p>Dave didn't respond.</p>

<p>Gorgonio smirked and glanced from one to the other.</p>

<p>"You scum," he sneered at them. "You're the ones who posted my face all over the news broadcast. Thanks to you I haven't been able to show myself in town."</p>

<p>At that moment, Venancio stepped into the room carrying two paper bags which smelled of food. "Anyone hungry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah! Let's eat!" yelled Theron.</p>

<p>"It's about time you got back...let's go to the hallway with the food." ordered Gorgonio.</p>

<p>Venancio glanced at the hostages and asked, "What about them?"</p>

<p>"To hell with them," answered Gorgonio, "They can't escape, besides, we'll be back within minutes." The three men left the room, leaving Samantha and Dave alone. Dave looked at the floor in silence, while Samantha looked around the room trying to assimilate all her surroundings; perhaps out of habit she wanted to remember every detail of her captivity. Dave's voice broke through her thoughts. "They <em>will</em> kill us, you know." he whispered.</p>

<p>Samantha didn't respond. She was thinking about her sister Leandra, back on Tropical Island. <em>I haven't called her for about two weeks. She's probably wondering how I'm doing.</em> Her thoughts faded into happy memories of her childhood on the island.</p><hr>

<p>Outside in the corridors of the warehouse, the hunters were sitting on the floor, eating. Theron spoke first.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we, at least, offer them water?" he said.</p>

<p>"What the hell for?" snapped Venancio, "They're gonna die anyway."</p>

<p>Theron felt angry and yelled back at him, "Yeah right, so you be the one to tell Ulrich that they died 'cuz you wouldn't keep 'em hydrated! Sorry Gov, no info!"</p>

<p>"You damn bastard!" shouted Venancio and dropping his sandwich, threw himself at Theron, smacking his face. Before Theron had a chance to react, Gorgonio intervened.</p>

<p>"Stop it, assholes! Actually, the kid's got a point. We need to keep 'em alive till Ulrich gives the order to get rid of them. Theron, take them some water."</p>

<p>Theron rubbed his cheek and giving Venancio an angry look, grabbed a thermos and a cup, and went over to the room where the hostages were.</p>

<p>He found the two, trying to pull themselves free. They glanced up at the doorway as he walked in.</p>

<p>"Are either of you thirsty?" Theron offered. "I've got water."</p>

<p>Dave gave him a distrustful look, and Samantha cynically replied, "No doubt you've laced it with cyanide."</p>

<p>Theron poured some of the water in the cup and drank it. Samantha and Dave glanced at one another. "Ok," Samantha said.</p>

<p>Theron could tell, although they refused to admit such, that they were both thirsty. He refilled the cup and went to Samantha. "Don't let Gorgonio and Venancio get to you," Theron told them, keeping his voice low. "They'll talk a lot of shit, but they won't do anything without Ulrich's orders."</p>

<p>"That's small comfort," Samantha murmured.</p>

<p>She drank some water and looked at Dave; Theron walked over to him and poured more water into the cup. "I've seen some of your news reports about the poaching," Theron continued. "You're both very determined to protect that source of yours, whomever he or she is."</p>

<p>"If you expect us to tell you who our source is," said Samantha, "we won't."</p>

<p>"I'm not," Theron replied, letting her photographer drink. "I'm actually kind of impressed. I'm sorry we're putting the two of you through this."</p>

<p>Samantha eyed him warily for a moment, until at last she said, "You don't really agree with all of this, do you."</p>

<p>It was more an observation than a plea, and it caught Theron somewhat by surprise. "No...I don't," he responded, honestly.</p>

<p>"Then why go along with it?" asked Samantha. "Won't you help us escape?"</p>

<p>Theron looked over his shoulder worriedly, remembering that the others were still outside in the corridor. "I can't," he whispered. "As much as I want to, I can't. Truth is...I wish I had never gotten involved in this fox hunting thing to begin with. They're gangsters, and they won't hesitate in killing me if they suspect that I'm thinking of turning against them."</p>

<p>"You can still get out of this," Dave told him. "We'll tell the police you helped us..."</p>

<p>"What's taking so long!" Gorgonio's voice at the doorway made Theron freeze. "They drank enough water. Are you trying to drown them?"</p>

<p>"Trying to get them to talk," Theron swiftly lied.</p>

<p>"You're going about it all wrong. ...By the way, isn't it drafty in here?" Without warning, Gorgonio grabbed the thermos out of Theron's hands and hurled the water at Samantha's face. She gasped.</p>

<p>"Stop it, Gorgonio," Theron said. "They already know they're being held hostage. Why do we need to harass them any more?"</p>

<p>"Because I damn want to," he responded.</p>

<p>Dave looked over at Samantha worriedly. She gave a small sneeze but said nothing. The water was icy.</p><hr>

<p>Roxanne reached the convention center after Ulrich had finished his speech. The sounds of a boisterous party, loud music and triumphant voters celebrating their candidate's win, could be heard coming from inside.</p>

<p>As she approached the building, she saw the governor exiting. The cat ducked underneath some nearby bushes and watched.</p>

<p>Denise walked outside after him, still wearing the fox stole around her shoulders. Roxanne hissed at it, but she didn't notice. "Overall, we've had a successful evening," the regional treasurer smiled.</p>

<p>"Now that I've won re-election I'm only a few steps away from the prime minister's office...although I may change the office title once I've liquidated parliament," Ulrich considered.</p>

<p>"What position will you give me as the new, sole ruler of Sarrilla?" asked Denise.</p>

<p>"Would you like to be head of my new propaganda ministry? Once we begin swallowing some of the other countries I'll need someone to suppress any dissenting opinions. You know Qiang says that's important to stay in power."</p>

<p>Roxanne was astounded. She knew Ulrich harbored dreams of unbridled power, but this was unbelievable. Just then Mabel came out of the building and, noticing the conversation, stayed near the entryway.</p>

<p>"Are you going back to the warehouse?" Denise asked Ulrich.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. Stay here, and try to maintain our good image for those idiots out there. Once I'm through with Samantha West I'll be heading back to the mansion."</p>

<p>Denise went back into the building. Roxanne was thinking about this when Mabel stepped forward. Ulrich seemed only mildly surprised to see her.</p>

<p>"Samantha West," said Mabel cautiously, "She's the TV reporter."</p>

<p>"How observant," Ulrich sarcastically replied, retrieving and lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Are you holding her hostage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, along with her photographer, until they tell me who snitched about my fur trade business," Ulrich smirked. When he saw the upset look in her eyes, he casually said, "Surprised, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"Victor," Mabel said, "I knew you were carrying on with that bitch Denise Ralston, and how you gave her that fox fur stole while you were still trying to delist the foxes; I knew that diplomat from Longguo had approached you one day about something that was most likely unethical at the least; but I never thought you were capable of kidnapping."</p>

<p>"I'm capable of more than kidnapping," he responded, "and if you think of trying to tell someone, you and that alley cat of yours will never live to do so."</p>

<p>Mabel looked frightened, and it took a moment for her to say: "I won't."</p>

<p>"Don't wait up for me," Ulrich said, as he turned and walked off.</p>

<p>Roxanne flattened her ears as Mabel retreated into the building. The cat looked back inside at the rally, where Ulrich's supporters were partying as if they had succeeded in some great deed, completely unaware of Samantha and Dave's plight or even the fact that they were celebrating the re-election of a fascist. She turned in the opposite direction and saw Ulrich driving off, his car becoming smaller as it vanished down the street...</p>

<p>It was a sudden decision. Roxanne chased after his car. Ulrich did not notice the longhaired cat racing down the street. Her paws pounded on the asphalt as she bounded after the car, her tail swishing behind her...desperation rose as the car picked up speed, and with a leap, she landed on the back hood of the vehicle. She nearly fell off as the car swerved. Before he could notice the cat, she crawled up onto the car roof and crouched there, the wind buffeting her black fur as he drove swiftly towards the warehouse.</p>

<p>"Geronimo was right," she mewed to herself.</p><h3>Chapter 23 - Inquisitor’s Second Degree</h3>

<p>Ambassador Qiang returned to the warehouse with his two bodyguards. When he walked in, he glanced around the room where the hunters and their hostages were, and declared in a loud voice, "The most inept way of doing things. In my country this would never be."</p>

<p>"What's he talking about?" said Venancio to Gorgonio.</p>

<p>"Don't make any difference to me. I get paid by the governor," Gorgonio answered.</p>

<p>"Maybe so," snapped Qiang. "But <em>I</em> pay the governor. Remember that."</p>

<p>At that moment, Governor Ulrich walked in. Ignoring the conversation, he walked straight to where the reporter and her cameraman were sitting, and spoke to Samantha.</p>

<p>"A pity you had to miss my re-election party. It was a grand show. I doubt they'll soon forget my victory speech. I’m sure it made great video on your news program."</p>

<p><em>He's so self-congratulatory it's annoying,</em> Samantha thought. "You're profiting off of the public's ignorance," she pointed out.</p>

<p>"Is that another affront to your pious sense of ethics?" laughed Ulrich. "Why do you care so much about the public?"</p>

<p>"Really, governor? You obviously do care, because you're always worried about getting their votes," she quickly answered.</p>

<p>"That's debatable but irrelevant." Ulrich dismissed the remark. "You were uncooperative about naming your source earlier. I imagine your accommodations here have made you reconss here have made you reconsider your stance."</p>

<p>"As I told you...I won't reveal my anonymous source," Samantha reiterated.</p>

<p>"Nor will I," added Dave.</p>

<p>"If you don't," Ulrich snarled, "I can assure you that neither of you will live to report another news story."</p>

<p>Samantha sighed. "Go ahead and hold me at gunpoint, like you did to Mr. Washburn...or like Gorgonio here already did to me while you were out making long-winded speeches. You'll get the same answer from both of us...<em>We won't reveal our sources</em>."</p>

<p>"She's stubborn," Gorgonio said.</p>

<p>"Psychological threats can only accomplish so much," Ambassador Qiang interjected. "She knows fully well you won't kill her. How could you? You want the information she possesses."</p>

<p>"If she won't talk she's of little use," responded Ulrich without removing his sharp gaze from Samantha.</p>

<p>"Certainly, but in my country, she would undoubtedly talk," the diplomat stated. "Our methods are more efficient."</p>

<p>Governor Ulrich looked over at him, and then at the poachers. With a quick motion, he silently called the small group out of the room and into the corridor. "You stay here," Gorgonio told Theron before walking out and leaving him alone to guard the hostages.</p>

<p>Everyone else walked a short distance away from the storage unit to be out of earshot. Ulrich turned to Qiang. "So what's your new idea?"</p>

<p>"Hardly a new one," the ambassador corrected. "In Longguo we have certain expertise in interrogating people, and we have perfected our methods. All she needs is the right sort of motivation."</p>

<p>"Whatever we're going to do, it's going to be crude. We have neither the equipment nor the know-how for your country's sophisticated motivational methods," Ulrich responded haughtily.</p>

<p>"Actually...we have both," Gorgonio interrupted.</p>

<p>They all looked over at him. When Ulrich spoke, his voice was cold. "What did you have in mind...?"</p>

<p>Gorgonio smiled, apparently enjoying the thought that they were asking for his input.</p>

<p>In the storage unit, Theron was fidgeting with the rifle he held, curious as to what the others could be saying in the hallway. Dave spoke softly to Samantha.</p>

<p>"I guess this will be it," he said.</p>

<p>"We've done a lot of good stories together, Dave," Samantha replied. "At least we're going, as a result of having done what we love."</p>

<p>Samantha gave a small sneeze. The water that had been thrown on her had almost entirely dried, leaving her chilly.</p>

<p>"That's true," said Dave. Neither of them spoke for a moment. "Did you manage to do what we talked about?" He was referring to the videotape.</p>

<p>"Yes." Remembering that they were in the room with a guard, she looked over suspiciously at Theron.</p>

<p>Theron was barely paying attention to the two journalists. Instead, he was standing at the doorway, trying to determine what the rest of the group was discussing. They were some distance down the hall, speaking in hushed tones, and Theron could not hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>"You know how Geronimo loves to help with our stories," she said. "He's always eager to come to the TV station..."</p>

<p>Dave thought about the statement for a moment. He nodded in understanding. "He's a smart cat," the photographer said.</p>

<p>The reporter gazed silently at the ropes binding her. For a moment she wondered if the videotape had arrived at the newsroom yet. Samantha could imagine the look Denise, Qiang, and Ulrich would have on their faces when they saw the film being broadcast; the only thing she felt saddened about was knowing she and Dave probably would not live to report the investigative story themselves. She tried guessing who Ted and Devon would assign to that story.</p>

<p>"Samantha..." It was Dave's voice. She looked over at him and saw his eyes glistening with emotion. "I love you...Samantha," he whispered.</p>

<p>"David..." she answered softly, "I love you too."</p>

<p>Their private moment was interrupted by Theron clearing his voice and saying, "Hey, someone's coming."</p>

<p>"Theron!" Venancio's voice called. He appeared beside Theron at the doorway and jerked his head as if for him to go. Theron glanced at the reporter and cameraman briefly and then slipped out into the corridor, where he found the others. Ulrich spoke swiftly and pointedly.</p>

<p>"Gorgonio tells me you know about electricity."</p>

<p>This made Theron alert, mostly because he had not expected the remark. "...Yes."</p>

<p>"What level of electricity is lethal for a human being?" Gorgonio asked.</p>

<p>"Depends on whether it's AC or DC," said Theron.</p>

<p>"What does that power source device of yours generate?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Alternating Current."</p>

<p>"Well, then."</p>

<p>"100 milliamperes," Theron replied promptly.</p>

<p>They stared at him, and he added awkwardly, "...for at least three seconds. But you'd feel a painful shock with far fewer milliamps."</p>

<p>"I thought electricity was measured in volts," Gorgonio questioned.</p>

<p>"Volts are electric potential," Theron explained. "When it comes to an electrical shock, it's the amperage - that's the rate of electron flow - that will tell you what effect it'll have on the body..." He stopped as Gorgonio glanced at the others and gestured towards him, as if proving something to them.</p>

<p>“You see what I mean?” Gorgonio said.</p>

<p>An uneasy feeling came over Theron. "Why the sudden interest?" asked Theron.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why," Gorgonio smirked maliciously, "Because you're going to wire a makeshift version of the electric chair. Give that insolent news reporter a few good jolts. See if <em>then</em> she won't talk!"</p>

<p>"That's...<em>torture</em>." Theron said slowly.</p>

<p>Ulrich answered him with a calm voice:</p>

<p>"Yes. It is."</p>

<p>Theron suddenly felt very afraid, but he said nothing. Almost in a daze, he obediently walked down the hallway to where he kept his electrical supplies.</p><hr>

<p>Governor Ulrich unceremoniously returned to the storage unit, followed by Qiang, Gorgonio, and the bodyguards.</p>

<p>The journalists looked up at him in silence.</p>

<p>"This is your last chance," Ulrich said sternly. "Name your source."</p>

<p>"Never," responded Samantha.</p>

<p>Theron entered the room and walked over to the table situated next to the hostages. All eyes turned to what he had brought in. It was a rectangular black box that on its front had a small switch and a little green light, apart from a dial with a capital <em>V</em> underneath which had numbers around it from 100 to 1,000. What was more impressive, though, was what was beside the dial. It was some sort of meter with a scale running from 0 to 100. A slender needle rested at zero, and two gilded letters on the face of the meter read: <em>mA</em>.</p>

<p>Samantha did not take her eyes off the contraption. Although she instinctually knew this was something evil, or which at the least would be put to ill use, she was at a loss as to what precisely it was.</p>

<p>Still fearless as ever, and with the same curious, impassive manner as she had when interviewing, Samantha asked:</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out," Ulrich told her.</p>

<p>Theron plugged the gadget into the wall socket and flipped the little switch; immediately the small green light flashed on.</p>

<p>"Sam," Dave turned to look at Samantha, "They're planning electro-shocks...Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Samantha looked into his eyes and answered calmly, "Yes. I understand perfectly. They will try torture."</p>

<p>"War may be an art, but torture is a science." Qiang said, almost as if giving a lecture. "We have found in Longguo electric shock one of most effective methods of interrogation..."</p>

<p>"I hate you," said Samantha.</p>

<p>No one responded; the governor merely looked at Gorgonio and motioned towards Samantha with his steely gaze. Having apparently resigned herself to the futility of the situation, the reporter didn't struggle as the lead poacher rolled up the sleeves of her blouse.</p>

<p>"I'll find your breaking point...no matter how long it takes," said Ulrich.</p>

<p>Samantha glanced up and said, "In that case, <em>please </em>hold your breath."</p>

<p>"Set the electricity to the level where she'll begin to feel pain," Ulrich ordered Theron.</p>

<p>"But this is inhumane!" Theron insisted.</p>

<p>At this outburst, Samantha and Dave kept their heads down, but all the others turned to stare at Theron with surprised and bewildered looks.</p>

<p>"Do it or you'll die," Ulrich growled at him.</p>

<p>There was a moment when Theron looked unsure; then, Theron took the two electrodes and touched them lightly to Samantha's arms. The skin where the copper contacted seemed to tingle slightly. Glancing at the meter, Theron lifted the wires and adjusted the dial to a higher voltage. He gave an apologetic look towards Samantha before wordlessly handing the cables to Ulrich and stepping aside.</p>

<p>"Ms. West," said Ulrich, "unless you tell me what I want to know, you will experience a lot of pain."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. I'll still never tell you," she replied swiftly.</p>

<p>Gorgonio had been watching impatiently. He didn't like the hostages and felt no remorse.</p>

<p>"Let me do it, governor," he said.</p>

<p>Ulrich beckoned him over and without looking away from Samantha, handed him the two electrodes.</p>

<p>"Motivate her to talk," he ordered.</p>

<p>In the blink of an eye, Gorgonio pressed the ends of the wires to her arms. The jolt of electricity that reached Samantha made her gasp and jerk back suddenly, but the restraints held her down. It was a penetrating, needle-like sensation that entered at one copper rod to traverse her arms and chest to her other hand, as if the energy deliberately sought the second connection. The shock seemed interminable, and when the wires were lifted she let out another breath, almost gratefully. The power had been on for only three seconds.</p>

<p>"Six milliamperes," Ulrich, who had glanced at the meter during the shock, dryly observed. "Theron said the lethal point is one hundred. You've seen what only six is like. If you insist in your stupidity we could go at this for hours, Samantha. You'd do best to act reasonably and tell us who your source is."</p>

<p>"You're the stupid one, if you think you can torture me into talking," Samantha retorted.</p>

<p>The words had no sooner left her lips, that Gorgonio again placed the electrodes on her arms. The needle on the meter once more flew up to mark 6 milliamperes, and Samantha clenched her teeth to bear the shock. She did not gasp this time nor make any outcry, and kept her eyes shut; as the electrodes were lifted she gave Ulrich a furious gaze, like a cat forced to tolerate some indignity and plotting revenge against the people responsible.</p>

<p>Ulrich gave her a patronizing look, as if her refusal to divulge the information was simply postponing an inevitability and her doing so was illogical.</p>

<p>"Tell me the name of your source."</p>

<p>"No," came Samantha's resolute answer.</p>

<p>The ambassador, who had been silently watching the proceedings along with his bodyguards and the hunters, now broke in.</p>

<p>"You are wasting your time protecting your informant. If you feel that your job informing the public is so important, what good are you to anyone if you are dead?"</p>

<p>"What good are any of us at informing the public if our sources don't trust us?" retorted Samantha. "Real reporters don't just broadcast press releases, we need sources to dig up news...and sources don't come forward unless they know we'll keep their secret. We need our sources to act like a free press should."</p>

<p>She flinched as Gorgonio shocked her again, rather arbitrarily, and when he broke the circuit she glared at him.</p>

<p>"I'll ask the questions," Ulrich snarled to Qiang under his breath.</p>

<p>"You have no experience as an inquisitor," Qiang told him.</p>

<p>Gorgonio, still standing ready at the dial, spoke up. "Let's raise the electricity and see if we can get her to scream!"</p>

<p>Ulrich gave him an unconcerned nod, as if telling him to go ahead; to which the lead hunter eagerly twisted the dial higher. Dave, who unable to free himself had been watching what they were doing to Samantha, spoke. "You're savages. What have we ever done to you?"</p>

<p>"Besides snooping into stuff that's none of your damn business?" said Gorgonio.</p>

<p>"It's ok, Dave," Samantha told her companion.</p>

<p>"I would just as soon release you if I could," Ulrich said. "Wouldn't you much rather be at home now, resting?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, you won't let me go," replied Samantha.</p>

<p>"I could...if you would identify your source."</p>

<p>"I don't reveal anonymous sources."</p>

<p>"That's easy to say," Ulrich answered, "but it's quite different when you're faced with your mortality. This is going to become very ugly soon, once the number on that meter starts rising, and when you truly realize you're being tortured to death you might just rethink things."</p>

<p>Samantha noticed his voice grow softer. "You must have family or friends somewhere who are worried about you. Surely, you don't want to die in this dismal place, without ever seeing them again. All you have to do is name your informant, and we'll forget you ever stumbled across...my business investment."</p>

<p>"Even if that were true, I'd still never name an anonymous source," she said.</p>

<p>"Why? Because you see it as a betrayal of your profession's code of ethics?" Ulrich smiled, a mixture of sarcasm and egotistic superiority. "You refuse to burn a source over an idealistic presumption that doing so would cripple the newsgathering ability of the press, and the public's precious right to know can never be sacrificed. Is it really so worth it as to get <em>fried</em> yourself? I swore to an oath too, Samantha, a ludicrous little formality that said something about upholding the Sarrillian constitution and all it stands for. Tell me," Ulrich asked her, "do you see me distraught over breaking that oath?"</p>

<p>"Your greed corrupted you," she said.</p>

<p>"Like your professional ethics will kill you," he retorted.</p>

<p>"Ethics are the roots of civilization," said Samantha.</p>

<p>"...and we are uncivilized? Perhaps." He turned dismissively to Gorgonio. "Raise the current."</p>

<p>The sight of the dial being turned to a higher setting was somehow itself agonizing, yet Samantha stayed silent.</p>

<p>Ambassador Qiang spoke to the governor again at this point, apparently disregarding the victim's presence.</p>

<p>"It will make little difference whether you continue that act of saying you will spare her life. If it has not worked by now, it will not work at all. We are more efficient in Longguo. When she feels the electricity scorching her body, begins imploring us for death so as not to suffer any more...then she'll talk."</p>

<p>"To hell with you. I'll never talk," Samantha said.</p>

<p>"You are worthless," answered Qiang. "Just like the people out there, who are useful only as long as they can serve the upper class."</p>

<p>At this point Ulrich interrupted, visibly annoyed at the thought that Qiang was trying to out-boss him.</p>

<p>"...I'll admit it, you're not going to leave here alive whether or not you identify your source - but doing so will make things easier for you." Ulrich's gaze became colder. "I can make the last few moments of your life be spent in excruciating agony.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never reveal my sources,” Samantha answered.</p>

<p>When the electrodes touched her arms, the needle moved upward a bit more, marking 10 milliamperes; searing pain made her jerk upright in a terrible spasm, her hands clenching themselves into fists which even by effort she could not reopen. She screamed and, when the switch was finally lifted, fell back trembling.</p>

<p>“Who's feeding you information?" Ulrich persisted.</p>

<p>“Fuck you," Samantha answered through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>10 milliamperes, again. She screamed once more. The pain was intolerable.</p>

<p>When her body drooped after the electric shock, it was Gorgonio who spoke, his voice sardonic.</p>

<p>“Gives a whole new meaning to ‘Reporting <em>Live</em>’, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Samantha looked up at him, and he laughed.</p>

<p>Dave was watching with disbelief, but at this he looked directly at the lead poacher. “In all my years as a news photographer…I never thought I would meet someone who <em>enjoys</em> inflicting such cruelty.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” Gorgonio snapped at him.</p>

<p>Dave ignored him. “You have a dark soul.”</p>

<p>Gorgonio flipped out the switchblade, and in an icily calm voice, answered:</p>

<p>“I’m not as bad as you think I am. I’m <em>worse</em>.”</p>

<p>Dave focused his eyes on him and, without a blink, retorted, “You’re a damn sadist.”</p>

<p>Angry, Gorgonio leapt at Dave, seizing him harshly by the collar; he would have struck him with the knife if Ulrich had not interjected.</p>

<p>“Stop! That’s enough, Gorgonio! Don’t waste your time with him.”</p>

<p>Gorgonio was not satisfied. “Why the hell do we need the camera guy, anyway? She’ll name the source eventually.”</p>

<p>"Think, you idiot" responded Ulrich. "If you kill him at this point where will you put him while we persuade her to talk? We might as well deal with them at the same time, then dispose them together."</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave looked at each other momentarily; with the realization that this might be their end. Nothing but a miracle could save them.</p><hr>

<p>Down in the lobby of the WCAT television station, people were surprised to see a large Husky dog run into the building, pushing open the doors with his paws, a videotape clutched in his mouth. The elevator doors were open at the moment, presenting the perfect opportunity for Zachary the dog to leap in and hit the button for the newsroom floor with a paw.</p>

<p>When the elevator reached its destination Zachary ran out, into the busy newsroom, directly towards the editor's office. Devon and Ted were both there; and stood up in surprise when the dog skidded to a halt in front of the office entrance and placed the tape on the floor. Zachary looked exhausted, as if he had run many miles without pause. The dog lay down, panting, and looked up at the men.</p>

<p>"Who's Ted, the editor?" Zachary asked.</p>

<p>"I am," said Ted.</p>

<p>Zachary gave the videotape a small push towards him with his nose, and Ted lifted the tape from the floor. On the tape's label, handwritten, were two names:</p>

<p><em>Reporter: Samantha West<br />
Photographer: David Candid</em></p>

<p>Ted could only look at the videotape, unable to speak, his disbelief overshadowed by the tragic knowledge of what this certainly meant; Devon, looking at the tape from over his shoulder, had fallen silent also. Zachary's low woof broke into their thoughts.</p>

<p>"They wanted that brought here."</p><h3>Chapter 24 - Inquisitor’s Third Degree</h3>

<p>The warehouse towered before Geronimo, Ivan, and Natasha, like an enormous mountain to the small animals. Standing on the fringes of the woodland, there was something ever more forbidding about it to them.</p>

<p>"I insist, this place is scary," said Natasha.</p>

<p>"How do we know your humans are still here?" asked Ivan. "They could have been moved out."</p>

<p>"We'll have to look around," Geronimo meowed. "It's too bad Roxanne isn't here! Without her, it'll be harder to find a way in."</p>

<p>The critters emerged from the bushes and padded forward, evaluating the territory. Other than the door in the alleyway, there appeared to be no alternate entrance. Geronimo padded boldly up to the warehouse door and standing on his hind legs, tried to push it open, but it would not budge.</p>

<p>"It's locked," he hissed.</p>

<p>A meow made the animals stop in their tracks. They looked up and saw, perched atop a stack of storage containers, the silhouette of a cat outlined against the green flame of the northern lights in the sky.</p>

<p>"Roxanne!" purred Geronimo.</p>

<p>She leapt down to join them. "Geronimo, you win. Too much is at stake...and I can't let your humans die just because they tried to expose the corruption."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Roxy," Geronimo purred, touching noses with her.</p>

<p>"How'd you get here before us?" Ivan yapped.</p>

<p>"I rode back with Ulrich," said Roxanne.</p>

<p>"Ulrich's here?" Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, he went inside. Later, I saw the Longguo ambassador arrive too," Roxanne told them. "Come on, I'll show you the way in."</p>

<p>They padded over to the holly bushes near the door but as Roxanne pawed at the opening, it became clear that it had been sealed shut. Apparently, a cinder block had been placed inside, preventing any critter from entering.</p>

<p>"They've blocked it," Roxanne hissed.</p><hr>

<p>Miles away, the moon shone brightly over Tropical Island; its reflection giving light to the gently lapping waves at the sea shore. Leandra West couldn't sleep. She got up out of bed and sat at the kitchen table. She sat there for a long time thinking and was oblivious to the fact that her husband was standing at the doorway.</p>

<p>"Anything interesting happening?" he said smiling at her.</p>

<p>Leandra turned, startled, and returned a smile. "No. I was just thinking about Samantha and the fact that it's been a few weeks that I don't hear from her. I hope she's OK..."</p>

<p>Before anything more could be said, the telephone rang. Leandra answered it and heard Ted's voice on the other end.</p>

<p>"Lee, I wanted you to know this from us personally, before you heard it on the news..." he began but didn't finish, because Leandra spoke up.</p>

<p>"Samantha...Dave... I had a feeling something was happening. Ted, are they alive?"</p>

<p>"We...don't know. They've sent a video tape with a messenger critter. We don't want to assume the worst, but I thought you should be aware of what's going on."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Ted...for calling. Please keep me up to date about things," she said, trying to contain her emotions.</p>

<p>"You bet I will," he said, and hung up.</p>

<p>Leandra placed the phone receiver on its cradle and looked at Laurence, who said, "I knew this sort of thing would happen sooner or later."</p>

<p>"So did I," answered Leandra, "and so did Samantha."</p>

<p>When Ted hung up the telephone, he turned back to the control room monitors. The anchors were in the studio, the tape was loaded into one of the videocassette players; they were ready to broadcast at his word. All eyes were upon him.</p>

<p>"Air the tape, now!" Ted told them.</p>

<p>It was somber yet triumphant for everyone in the newsroom as the tape was broadcast across the nation. It was bittersweet; they had abandoned their colleagues to whatever fate might befall them so that the people might know - a journalists' farewell.</p><hr>

<p>For Samantha West, it had reached that point where the inexplicable thing was not that the electric shocks would ultimately kill her, but that they delayed so long in doing so. The pain was excruciating, and her only respite from it was when Ulrich was shouting at her. She would never reveal her source - indeed the mere thought of doing so was anathema to her - and so, as time dragged on, her torturers' persistence seemed to become ever more stupid to her, just as to them, her persistence became ever more absurd.</p>

<p>The electricity had been left at the setting of 14 milliamperes. Higher than this would start to impede her breathing, Theron had warned, hence it had now become a sort of sadistic waiting game. Ulrich wanted Samantha to reveal her source, Samantha refused to; Samantha wanted Ulrich to give up already, Ulrich would not; and Dave watched in silent, mental anguish.</p>

<p>"You know, I said they would probably not soon forget my victory speech. I was wrong. In fact, I think it'll be overshadowed by my condolence speech tomorrow, when they find your lifeless bodies beside the news van outside," Ulrich said. "The dedicated TV news crew, martyrs for press freedom. I think I'll make a show of calling for your killers to be brought to justice."</p>

<p>Samantha didn't answer. She was becoming lightheaded from the shocks. Drops of perspiration shone on her forehead, and a thin line of sweat trickled down the side of her face.</p>

<p>Ulrich yelled at her, "Name the source, you stubborn fool!"</p>

<p>Samantha ignored him and said nothing.</p>

<p>Gorgonio brought the electrodes down to contact her arms again, and she screamed as the electricity was applied. The lead poacher seemed fiendishly pleased when the needle jerked up to mark 14 milliamperes.</p>

<p>"This anonymous source of yours isn't worth your life," Ulrich told her when the circuit was broken and she fell back shuddering. "A person's own life should be their most valued possession. What benefit do you get out of risking it like this?"</p>

<p>Samantha stared at him, astounded he would say such an egocentric thing. Finally, she spoke:</p>

<p>"You say I ought to value my own life above all else, and you ask what benefit I get from risking my life. If everyone thought like you, there would be no firemen who go into burning buildings to rescue lives trapped inside...no doctors who travel to epidemic-ravaged lands to cure deadly diseases...no soldiers who defend the country..."</p>

<p>"How pretentious of you," Ulrich scoffed, "to equate news-writers with the safety of the nation."</p>

<p>"You're wrong, governor," Samantha said, her voice soft and weary. "Democracy lives with the voice of the people...and that voice would fall silent without those who investigate so the people can know what's happening in the world, so they can make the informed choices they need to be able to make to safeguard our democracy. But of course you don't want a democracy," she continued as Ulrich gave her a wearied, somehow self-righteous look. "I've never said what I thought, because it wasn't my place as a reporter, but do you really want to know what I think? You're a coward who has to resort to tying up and torturing someone because he doesn't have the intelligence enough to recognize that he can't buy or terrify everyone...that there <em>are</em> ethical ideals worth fighting and dying for because they keep our nation from devolving into a slave society with someone like you at the top!"</p>

<p>"You think you're perfect," Ulrich snapped.</p>

<p>"Perfect?" Samantha said, "Is that why you think of your own benefit instead of the benefit to humanity, your own life instead of the lives of others...? I'm certainly not perfect, but if it makes me elitist to believe in this concept of self-sacrifice, then so be it. No matter what torture you put me through, no matter if I was the last being in this world to stand for freedom, I will always firmly believe that the people have a right to know!"</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence in the room, and then Ulrich turned to Gorgonio and said:</p>

<p>"Shock her."</p>

<p>As the current ran through her, she screamed. Dave watched unable to do anything. He felt ill. It sickened him to see the metal flash of the wires touch her skin; her screaming helplessly until they broke the electric circuit. The constant barrage of insults being hurled at them, the intense stress of watching someone he loved being tortured, all these things within the small confines of a warehouse storage room. His stomach was upset yet he couldn't have the relief of throwing up. Dave was growing angry and angrier.</p>

<p>Soon he could not hold back his ire anymore, "You bastards!" he yelled at the crooks, "It's so easy for you to treat a woman this way...Bet you don't have the balls to fight me like a real man would. Untie me, and see if you can!"</p>

<p>Ulrich looked at him in surprise. Dave's face had changed from the time they had caught him. His usual complacent demeanor had come to seem vicious.</p>

<p>"Seems the cameraman is willing to die for his friend. How nice...however, I'll deal with you later," answered the governor, and turned his attention back to Samantha.</p>

<p>"You think your little news report could have brought me out of power?" he began, "You think your anonymous source can do it? Even if he went to a dozen other newspapers and TV stations...no, even if I had let your precious videotape air, it would be dismissed by the public, the instant they saw it. You're naive; you place too much faith in them, so stop saying so much shit and give me the name of your source."</p>

<p>Samantha took a deep breath and began to recite, "I do solemnly swear to uphold freedom of press and speech, and the right of the people to know...to report the news truthfully and fairly, and to forego any activity which may compromise my ability to do so...and to safeguard all sources of information to whom I have vowed confidentiality...until my last breath."</p>

<p>No one spoke. They all stared at her, shocked that she would be so steadfast in her ideals; all were amazed except for Dave, who thought to himself, <em>That's my Samantha. Loyal to the end.</em></p>

<p>A motion from Ulrich made the pain resume. It was hopeless not to shriek, yet when Gorgonio removed the electrodes she repeated the oath. At intervals, she cut off with an agonized cry as Gorgonio interrupted her with the electric shocks, but she persisted:</p>

<p>"I do solemnly swear...to uphold freedom of press and speech...and the right..."</p>

<p>"...the right of the people to know...to report the news truthfully..."</p>

<p>"...and fairly...and to forego any activity which may..."</p>

<p>"...compromise my ability...to do so...and to safeguard...all sources of information...”</p>

<p>“…to whom I have vowed confidentiality...until my last breath."</p>

<p>When Gorgonio lifted the wires, she collapsed, shaking; her heart jumped ahead in tachycardia. She noticed the ropes binding her right arm had loosened somewhat, perhaps from the repeated convulsions. Ulrich bent over her and said, "It might very well <em>be</em> your last breath."</p>

<p>Without warning, Samantha pried herself free and in a swift motion, slashed her fingernails across Ulrich's cheek. Ulrich raised his hand to his face, taking a step back as Samantha reached to her arm trying to pull off the binding ropes, but before she could, Gorgonio and Venancio jumped to her and tied her back down. Samantha struggled but it was to no avail. When she was secured to the chair, Ulrich stepped forward and smacked her face so hard she let out a sharp cry.</p>

<p>"Bitch!" he said. "You're too feisty for your own good."</p>

<p>Theron had at last become disgusted with the whole thing. "Do any of you have a cigarette?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ulrich stopped rubbing his cheek, reached into his pocket and retrieved a pack of cigarettes, which he threw at Theron without saying a word.</p>

<p>Venancio sneered at the younger hunter and asked, "Since when do you smoke?"</p>

<p>"Since now," Theron retorted, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Ambassador Qiang turned to leave also, and a perplexed Ulrich left the hostages and followed him out into the corridor.</p>

<p>"You're not staying to see the outcome of this?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It has been three hours," Qiang responded. "She is too strong-willed. You will never break her."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have some experience in this matter," Ulrich sarcastically said.</p>

<p>"In Longguo, I oversaw our interrogations before I was appointed ambassador to Sarrilla," Qiang replied seriously. "I have seen prisoners like her. They believe too strongly in their ideals, be they political or professional. It is the same with this reporter West. You can torture her until she dies and she still will never tell you the identity of her informant."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Ulrich impatiently asked, "how <em>do</em> you get these kind of people to talk in Longguo?"</p>

<p>"We don't," said Qiang. "We execute them."</p>

<p>Ulrich gave him an incredulous look.</p>

<p>The ambassador continued, "Interrogating her any more is a useless endeavor. I would shoot them both."</p>

<p>"We don't all have diplomatic immunity," the governor scoffed. "The tape might have been destroyed but I'd still like to know who the source is."</p>

<p>"That matter is entirely up to you, but I believe you are wasting your time," Qiang said.</p>

<p>Qiang left quickly and Ulrich walked back into the storage unit. Samantha had recovered slightly; she was no lotill pale. She was sitting back in the chair, and when she saw Ulrich again she tried to move her head forward, however weakness and dizziness made this difficult and she leaned back again, giving Ulrich a piercing look.</p><hr>

<p>Outside, Theron was leaning against the wall beside the doorway. He took a cigarette out of the box, lit it with a match and started to smoke it. He saw Qiang exiting the building, muttering something in Chinese to his bodyguards as they walked to the limousine.</p>

<p>When they had driven off, Theron turned back to the cigarette. The early morning weather was chilly, and the sky was still dark. Out here, it was impossible to hear the interrogation in the warehouse, and Theron shivered at the quiet and stillness. The only sounds were the rustling of the bushes and pine trees.</p>

<p>Theron had developed an intense dislike for Ulrich and the others. He felt really bad for the journalists and wished he could do something to help them. His mind thought over and over about the torture Ulrich had demanded be inflicted. <em>Damn the day I got mixed up with these people,</em> he thought.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, he noticed four pairs of glowing eyes watching him from the holly bushes. He froze.</p>

<p>"Theron!" It was Roxanne. As she padded out of the bushes with her tail up, a distrustful fox-growl warned: "He's one of the hunters!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>ffftt</em>! He doesn't agree with the others!" said the cat.</p>

<p>Theron crouched down to stroke her as the other animals crept out of the bushes. A suspicious Geronimo had flat ears, while Ivan and Natasha had their fangs bared. "Roxanne, what are you doing here?" Theron asked her.</p>

<p>"Saving my friend Geronimo's humans," Roxanne announced, swishing her tail to gesture towards the Siamese-mix tomcat.</p>

<p>"The TV news crew?" Theron hadn't realized that Samantha and Dave had a pet.</p>

<p>"Yes," meowed Geronimo. "Are they all right?"</p>

<p>"Well, they're still alive," Theron said plainly. He looked at the small band of determined critters. "There are only four of you," he observed. "How do you plan to rescue them?"</p>

<p>"We're going to attack by surprise," Geronimo replied.</p>

<p>Theron thought about this for a moment. <em>Critters attacking...it's so unexpected, it might actually work,</em> he realized.</p>

<p>"Wait," Ivan suddenly yapped, "I recognize you. You're the one who prevented us from being shot the other day."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" questioned Natasha.</p>

<p>"I’ve had enough of the poaching," Theron sighed. "I never realized how far the governor would go. I'm so sorry for all the havoc we've been causing you foxes. I wish I could reverse it somehow, but the best I can do now is to help you rescue your human friends."</p>

<p>“It's a start,” Geronimo mewed. “I hope we’re not too late. If my humans have been killed, all hell is going to break lose in there, because I’m not going to just sit back and let it go unpunished.” He ended his statement with a hiss.</p>

<p>Theron nodded. "You have to hurry," he said, opening the door behind him and leading the animals in.</p><h3>Chapter 25 - Thaw</h3>

<p>What struck Geronimo foremost about the warehouse interior was how pitch-black it was. It was so murky, it was difficult even for his feline eyes to see.</p>

<p>Theron walked ahead of the little group of critters, leading them down the hallway. As they rounded a corner, there was more light, although it flickered at intervals. "Samantha and Dave are being held in one of the storage units, towards the end of the corridor," Theron told them.</p>

<p>At that very moment, Venancio walked out of one of the rooms, and Theron hurriedly pushed open one of the other doors. "In here!" he whispered, and the critters all ducked into the storage room. It was small and barren except for a stack of crates that reached almost up to the ceiling. The wire mesh running along the top of the ceiling was broken here.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing?" Venancio's voice was heard out in the hallway as Theron closed the storage unit door.</p>

<p>"Coming back inside, to make sure no one short-circuits my electrical equipment," Theron said, feigning a lack of sympathy for the journalists.</p>

<p>"So why'd you open this door? What's in there?" Venancio demanded, and knocked against the metal wall that served to divide the storage room from the hallway. All the critters flattened themselves to the ground.</p>

<p>"I can open whatever door in here I want," Theron answered. "What do you think is in there, arctic foxes? The whole place is empty."</p>

<p>Just then, another sound made all the critters jump. Geronimo's fur stood on end when he heard his human, Samantha, screaming.</p>

<p>"What are they <em>doing</em> to her? We have to find a way over there!" Geronimo hissed.</p>

<p>"I heard someone in there," Venancio declared. Pushing Theron out of the way, he pulled open the storage unit door and looked inside.</p>

<p>There was nothing there, except for the stack of crates reaching up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Well?" questioned Theron.</p>

<p>"Come on," Venancio said in a bad mood and turned around, walking away leaving Theron to shut the door. Theron pushed the door forward but left a crack open, in case the animals needed a way out.</p>

<p>From above, precariously standing atop the wire mesh, the critters watched Venancio and Theron walk down the corridor. The cats and foxes went unnoticed by the people below. "You're really paranoid, Venancio. You were acting as if I was hiding someone in there or something."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Theron."</p>

<p>The critters exchanged a nervous look. "Step lightly," Roxanne purred, "One wrong step and we'll go crashing down."</p>

<p>Geronimo took the lead, walking gingerly with Roxanne and the two foxes following. He tried whenever possible to step on the support beams as opposed to the wire mesh itself, but there were areas where this was impossible. Whenever this happened, the mesh sagged down.</p>

<p>Before long, they began to hear Ulrich's voice speaking, and they came to the storage unit where the hostages were being held. The critters stared down into the improvised torture chamber, not entirely sure what it was that they were witnessing.</p><hr>

<p>Samantha was hurting. She was resolute in her goal to not let Ulrich win. She refused to reveal her source, no matter the pain or ultimate cost. With each surge of electricity coursing through her body, she grew more silent and finally, her head fell forward.</p>

<p>Ulrich spoke. “The pain will end as soon as you tell us the identity of your source.”</p>

<p>A weary Samantha shook her head from side to side.</p>

<p>“You will eventually,” Ulrich scoffed. “Again with your stupid professional ethics. Do you realize how that sounds?” He leaned over her, grasping her arm, and she winced with pain. “Ethics, are flimsy changeable rules that were meant to be broken, created and governed by those in power.”</p>

<p>There was some self-evident fallacy in this reasoning, Samantha could tell, but in her exhausted state she could not discern what that was. <em>How long had this torture been going on? </em>She glanced at Ulrich’s hand, noticing his wristwatch and found – with a certain measure of surprise - that she could no longer tell the time. She was aware that the symbols surrounding the clock’s face were numbers with the direction of the hands conveying meaning, yet those numbers were as a cipher – significant yet unintelligible.</p>

<p>Ulrich observed her gazing dizzily at his watch but ignored it. “You think that the public’s right to know outweighs your suffering, isn’t that right? Well, let me be the first to tell you that your ethics are outdated.” He smirked and stepped away from her, “You must learn that whether the public hears or not, it makes no difference. I am a very powerful man; the people believe in me and will not heed your words.”</p>

<p>Samantha interrupted. “The people don’t know the real you,” she said, noticing for the first time, how tired her voice had become.</p>

<p>A pause here, and Ulrich stared at her pensively – then spoke. “The common people have no say in whether I go down or not, they have no power…the rich have the power and the control, and <em>they </em>will keep me here for as long as their purposes are met.”</p>

<p>Samantha felt sick. The electric shocks were taking effect, but her strong will prevailed. She remained silent and Ulrich grabbed her face with both hands, forcing her to look at him. “Your suffering is worthless, don’t you see? You will die here, your cameraman will die here, and the corruption will persist forever. I hold a seat of power and intend to climb the ladder up until I become prime minister. Once I am prime minister, there will be no opposition. Your ludicrous notion of the people’s right to know, will be as forgotten to the public as you will be to them in a few weeks. The corruption is entrenched as tundra locked in permafrost.”</p>

<p>He released her and Samantha’s mind drifted beyond her own memories, to a timeline where always the tyrant tried to suppress the defiant; the dictator proving that men were more savage than beasts and yet, no human could ever prevent the sunrise. When she at last spoke, her voice was low and clear, yet it held a fearless tone that was unmistakable. She looked directly into his eyes and a small weak smile crossed her face as she replied:</p>

<p>“Go on, kill me. Even <em>permafrost</em> thaws in the sunlight.”</p>

<p>Ulrich stared at her in complete surprise. This response of hers had taken him totally off guard, and this angered him. He pushed Gorgonio out of the way, grabbing the wires from him and twisting the dial to its highest setting.</p>

<p>Samantha closed her eyes in sickening expectation, but the shock that followed was unlike all the others they had inflicted on her. When Ulrich touched the electrodes to her wrists, she was seized with burning pain; her body stiffened and her eyes flew wide open. It was a horrible sensation that radiated down her back and felt as though it would tear her apart. The meter's needle had swung full-scale, to mark 100 milliamperes, and unable to progress remained quivering on the spot. The sinister crackle of the electrical current could be heard in the absence of the reporter's screams. She couldn't breathe.</p>

<p>Her cameraman had gone pale and was watching, appalled and helpless, as a thin wisp of smoke rose from the device and from the wires where they contacted Samantha's wrists. Above, the critters could not believe the extent of the cruelty; they were uncertain as to when they should take action. Theron could stand it no longer, and with a quick movement of the hand, pulled the plug out of the outlet. Just as suddenly, the needle fell back to zero and the reporter slumped in her seat, eyes closed.</p>

<p>A visibly distraught Dave remained speechless.</p>

<p>Ulrich removed the electrodes and looked up in fury to see a defiant Theron facing him.</p>

<p>"Yes, governor," he said tersely, "I pulled the plug."</p>

<p>Ulrich pushed Theron to the ground, saying, "You fool! How dare you!"</p>

<p>Gorgonio's voice made the governor glance back towards Samantha. "She looks dead."</p>

<p>Ulrich placed his hand on Samantha's neck for a brief moment and announced, "There's a heartbeat. She's only fainted."</p>

<p>Hearing those words were a relief for Dave; he took in a deep breath and exhaled slowly.</p>

<p>Ulrich was angrier than ever and said, "As soon as she wakes up again, I'm going to make that damn reporter wish I <em>had</em> killed her..." His cell phone rang, interrupting him, and he answered it brusquely, "Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Victor, it's all over the news," Denise's voice came on the other line. "We've got to leave Sarrilla. The police were at my apartment..."</p>

<p>"What...?"</p>

<p>"The tape, Victor! It was on Channel 8, along with those reporters' pictures saying that they've gone missing."</p>

<p>"That can't be," he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"It can very much be. It’s on TV right now. It’s been played over and over on all the channels. This is a disaster, Victor. There's no way your public relations team is going to get any of us out of this one. Half the public is crying that you're a murderer destroying the environment, and the other half is saying you've betrayed your constituents' trust. Not to mention the press is calling you a..."</p>

<p>"You're no saint yourself!" he snapped furiously. "To hell with what the press says. They're the ones stirring up all this trouble with that fucking tape. I still want the name of that anonymous source who tipped them off so I can <em>personally</em>..."</p>

<p>"Are you kidding me? You just don't get it. Our careers are ruined." Denise was adamant. "Forget about your glorious re-election win. They're talking about impeachment. Are you still at the warehouse?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, get out of there. The cops are going to fall on that place like a band of hawks, and the media's bound to be right behind them. I was able to get out of my apartment by a stroke of luck."</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"On the highway." There was a background sound of a rotor slicing through the wind. "Oh shit! It's a news helicopter! I'll call you back."</p>

<p>Denise hung up, and Ulrich was still in a daze as he put the cell phone away. Gorgonio was looking quizzically at him.</p>

<p>"That damn tape's on the air," announced Ulrich.</p>

<p>Samantha was coming to, and she weakly looked over at the governor. There was an acrid taste in her mouth, and her entire body felt numb and hurt. A burnt smell still lingered in the air. She turned to Dave and managed a small smile; her cameraman winked an eye at her and whispered to her:</p>

<p>"Our tape aired."</p>

<p>Ulrich saw this and his stunned reaction to the tape's broadcasting gave way to hatred for the hostage TV news crew. He looked at Gorgonio and gesturing to the reporter and cameraman ordered, "Kill them, and when you're finished with them," he added, pointing to Theron, "take care of him."</p>

<p>"That'll be my pleasure," Gorgonio smirked.</p>

<p>Theron seemed to be in a state of shock, watching speechlessly as Gorgonio flipped open the revolver and loaded it. Samantha and Dave just gazed at each other accepting their fate; neither one said a word, not even when the cylinder snapped back into place and the gun was aimed point-blank...</p>

<p>"<em>Mrreeowwrrr</em>!" Geronimo screeched, slamming his weight onto the wire mesh and plummeting down onto Gorgonio's head. The cat sank his claws in and held on for dear life, hissing. The gun fired, and missed by inches.</p>

<p>"Now!" growled Ivan, and he and the other critters leapt down, snarling and caterwauling, onto the astonished criminals below. As a growling Natasha began snapping at Venancio, a flat-eared Roxanne attacked Governor Ulrich. He reached for his gun, but Roxanne took a flying leap and latched onto his arm, sinking her claws and fangs into his skin. He dropped the revolver and tried to pry her off.</p>

<p>Gorgonio forced the yowling Geronimo off and reached for his rifle, only to be bitten on his leg by Ivan the fox.</p>

<p>"You damn canine," he snapped, trying to kick him. Ivan yapped and dashed out of the storage unit. Forgetting about both Geronimo and the hostages, Gorgonio ran after the fox, and Geronimo raced after Gorgonio.</p>

<p>Theron, meanwhile, had leapt up. Taking Gorgonio's switchblade from the table, he hurriedly cut off the ropes binding Dave. The cameraman jumped out of the chair but almost fell down, both from the beating he had received earlier and from having been seated for so long. "Help Samantha," Dave said.</p>

<p>As Theron released Samantha, it became evident that she could barely move from weakness. She tried to reach up and grab Dave's sleeve to pull herself out of the chair, but her arm fell and she felt a jab of pain. Gazing dizzily at her arms, Samantha realized that besides sore marks left on her wrists by the ropes, there were red burns where the electrodes had contacted her skin.</p>

<p>"Dave," she said. Her voice, expended by her pained cries during the torture, had become so soft as to be nearly inaudible.</p>

<p>The cameraman helped her up, holding her from collapsing, and she leaned on him. The reporter was shivering, her heart still beating with unusual rapidity. Somehow, after all of those electro-shocks, what she felt was terribly cold. "Come on, Sam," Dave said reassuringly.</p>

<p>He helped her to the entrance of the storage unit, and Theron pointed down the corridor. "Go down this way and turn left at the end. The exit is there."</p>

<p>"We won't forget you helped us," Dave told him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Theron felt himself grabbed by his collar from behind, and as he turned around he saw it was Venancio. Natasha, meanwhile, was biting Venancio on the leg but it didn’t stop him from hitting Theron.</p>

<p>"I always knew you couldn't be trusted, you asshole!" Venancio snapped at the younger hunter.</p>

<p>"Go!" Theron waved Samantha and Dave off, and punched Venancio.</p>

<p>Ulrich saw the journalists leaving, but he was tussling with Roxanne. "Get off of me, you dumb animal!" he yelled at her. "You're getting kicked out of the governor's mansion too, no thanks to that newswoman and her unnamed source!"</p>

<p>He pushed the cat off, and she faced him as she landed on all four paws. Her back was arched and her fluffy tail was frizzed to double of its usual size; Roxanne’s ears were flat and her fangs bared in a ferocious hiss.</p>

<p>"<em>I'm</em> her anonymous source!"</p>

<p>He stared at the cat incredulously for a moment, shocked into silence. She continued hissing:</p>

<p>"Who else do you think would have known all your secrets? You underestimated me; you were so stupid you didn't think a simple housecat would listen and reveal your corruption to the world. I'd had enough of your cheating on Mabel, of your treatment of me, of your thinking you could do any cruel thing you wanted with impunity. That's why I not only became Samantha's source...I called her at the TV station to begin with!" said the cat, launching herself at Ulrich with a caterwaul.</p>

<p>The governor caught Roxanne by her amethyst collar and hurled her backwards. She collided with Natasha, who was helping Theron fight Venancio, and the two critters toppled into a stack of empty cardboard boxes. One of the boxes fell on them, trapping them underneath.</p>

<p>Ulrich grabbed his revolver, which had fallen to the floor, and ran after Samantha and Dave. The thought of his being undone by an animal was too much for him, as was the idea of his being politically discredited in the media. For all the harm he had caused, he blamed Samantha for having exposed him and he refused to let her return to her career while he spent the rest of his life in jail.</p><h3>Chapter 26 - Revenge of the lemmings</h3>

<p>Ivan ran into the forest, ducking bullets from Gorgonio's rifle. Bounding over a creek, the poacher's footsteps sounded more distant and the fox turned to see. Gorgonio could be seen far back among the pine trees, but Ivan appeared to be evading the hunter.</p>

<p>Ivan continued running and at last he reached the Whirlpool River gorge, which continued winding through the forest until it eventually divided the city and the woodland at a point farther down. The fox could just make out the Vaharis city lights some distance away, contrasted with the sky's natural pale blue light as the sun began to rise over Nortenya.</p>

<p>Realizing he could go no farther, Ivan ducked behind a large boulder. Here he stayed, trying to quiet his breathing.</p>

<p>Gorgonio came closer to where the fox had seemingly vanished. He glanced around, then looked down at the ground. Here, deep in the forest, the air was colder and much of the snow had not yet melted. Marked in the snow for all to see, were Ivan's pawprints.</p>

<p>With a smirk, the hunter stepped behind the boulder where Ivan was hiding and pointed his rifle at him. The fox was now trapped between the boulder and the cliff, with his only escape route blocked by Gorgonio.</p>

<p>Before he could shoot, Ivan jumped at him. He batted the fox with the rifle, and the animal fell over the edge of the cliff. Ivan managed to catch onto a narrow ledge halfway down with his claws and pull himself up.</p>

<p>Ivan looked up, his bushy tail swishing from side to side. Unbeknownst to Gorgonio, Geronimo had caught up and seen everything.</p>

<p>The poacher raised his rifle and aimed at the fox, and in the blink of an eye Geronimo leapt with a yowl to Ivan's defense. Gorgonio was struck in the back by the cat's sharp claws, and with a cry struggled to get the caterwauling Geronimo off. He succeeded, and the Siamese-mix cat was tossed roughly down where Ivan had been beside the boulder.</p>

<p>"All right, if you want to be such a hero I'll kill you first." the poacher smirked, snapping back the rifle's safety catch.</p>

<p>Geronimo braced himself for the shot, when suddenly...unexpectedly...there was a squeak.</p>

<p>Gorgonio looked down, almost bewildered, to see what creature would dare interrupt him, and saw a lemming.</p>

<p>It was seated on his shoe, looking up at him.</p>

<p>He kicked it away. Geronimo flinched to see the small animal being thrown back with such force.</p>

<p>There was another squeak, and the hunter turned to see a second lemming perched on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What the fuck...?"</p>

<p>The lemming bared orange, jagged fangs and began chirping angrily.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gorgonio was assailed by lemmings, leaping out of the bushes and hurling themselves at him. There were hundreds, thousands of the fluffy little rodents. Chirping together in a fearsome noise, they swarmed him, biting wherever they could sink their fangs into. Geronimo watched in disbelief as Gorgonio yelled, dropping the rifle, and tried to pull them off. They were too small to shoot, there were too many of them to push away, and more kept coming, scurrying out of the bushes; a multitude of vicious, vengeful lemmings with one unified objective.</p>

<p>The poacher stumbled back, trying to somehow flee from the lemmings, and in so doing reached the edge of the cliff. With a horrified scream, Gorgonio fell backwards, into the gorge, down into the raging whirlpools and sharp rocks below, with hundreds of rodents still clinging to him. The lemmings still on the land squeaked triumphantly, and in large numbers hurled themselves off of the cliff after him. They spread their paws out as they flew down into the violent rapids.</p>

<p>An astonished Geronimo was taken by surprise when he heard a squeak near his paws. He looked down to see the lemming he had helped escape from the branches in the city, now pregnant. The lemming twitched its whiskers delightedly.</p>

<p>"We lemmings never forget," she said scurrying off, into the woods and away from the cliff.</p>

<p>As the rush of lemmings dissipated, Geronimo noticed Ivan. The fox was pressed against the side of the cliff, staring out to the waves where the lemmings and Gorgonio had vanished.</p>

<p>"Ivan!" Geronimo meowed.</p>

<p>"Didn't we say lemmings were vicious?" Ivan prompted. "Geronimo, you'd better go back to the warehouse and check on your humans."</p>

<p>"How will you get back up?" the tomcat asked.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, the park rangers will get me out of here," said the fox. "They’ll lower a basket down and pull me up. You need to make sure your humans are ok."</p>

<p>Geronimo nodded and ran back towards the storage facility.</p><hr>

<p>During this time, Samantha and Dave had made their way out of the warehouse. As they stumbled outside, they found the news van where it had been left. Upon seeing it, though, the TV reporter and cameraman collapsed on the asphalt.</p>

<p>The antenna transmitter was up, and entangled in power lines above.</p>

<p>They looked up at it despondently, just as Governor Ulrich ran up to them and got in their path. He pointed his revolver directly at Samantha, and Dave tried to shield her.</p>

<p>"You fucking bitch. You think you can destroy my career, do you?" Ulrich snarled at her. "You and your cameraman will still die, and when I'm done with you that treacherous feline Roxanne will lose her nine lives for acting as your anonymous source."</p>

<p>There was a sound of cars screeching. Ulrich looked up to see police cars, an ambulance, and another Channel 8 news van, coming up the street. He turned back to the two journalists, who were huddled together on the asphalt gazing wordlessly at him.</p>

<p>"The thaw might have begun, but you'll never live to see the spring." Ulrich smiled. "You're signing off for good, Ms. West."</p>

<p>Samantha's emerald green eyes locked with his pale blue ones, and weak as she was, her voice somehow regained its strength, as if she was once more reporting live on the air:</p>

<p>"Back to you, governor."</p>

<p>Suddenly a meow was heard and from the holly bushes, Geronimo ran out towards Ulrich. Ulrich reacted instinctually, backing away, and in so doing put his hand on the news van behind him.</p>

<p>There was a flash of light, the crackle of electric current traveling from the power lines down the antenna mast, through the news van and through Ulrich to the ground, and he yelled as his hand seized hold of the door handle. He was trapped in a convulsion, and as his other hand jerked the gun fired upward. A parallel bolt of electricity arced out from the power lines, colliding with the bullet in mid-transit. Samantha and Dave stared at the spectacle in shock as the police, paramedics, and other reporters rushed over. The governor was screaming as smoke began to rise from where he was contacting the news van.</p>

<p>As the other reporters filmed, one of the policemen broke open a metal case on one of the electric poles and pulled an emergency switch. In an instant, Ulrich collapsed limply onto the asphalt. His eyes were closed, and he didn't appear to be breathing as the paramedics hurried over.</p>

<p>Geronimo padded to where Samantha and Dave were. He purred and rubbed against them, his tail up.</p>

<p>Inside the warehouse, Theron and Venancio were still struggling. Venancio reached for the revolver that Gorgonio had dropped, but Theron pushed it away. Roxanne and Natasha, still trapped under the box, found a crack in the cardboard and tried to see what happened as the fight unfolded.</p>

<p>The two men fought like wild animals, punching and kicking until Venancio finally grabbed hold of the revolver. They both struggled for the gun and it went off, hitting Theron. He fell back on the floor, bleeding from his shoulder.</p>

<p>Venancio aimed the gun a second time at Theron and said, "This is your end."</p>

<p>Before he could shoot, a dozen police officers rushed through the doors shouting, "Police! Drop it!"</p>

<p>Venancio looked from the police standing with weapons drawn at the entrance of the storage unit, to Theron, and back...and dropped the revolver. As the police handcuffed him, Venancio glared at Theron but said nothing.</p>

<p>Paramedics rushed over to Theron, who was clutching his arm in pain, and after a quick inspection of the wound, one of the medics said, "The bullet will be taken out at the hospital."</p>

<p>"It hurts like hell," said Theron.</p>

<p>A police officer interrupted. "Chloroform," he said, holding up the empty vial with a plain label.</p>

<p>Theron spoke up, "It was used to kidnap the news reporters."</p>

<p>"Well, the hospital uses it to relieve pain," added the police officer. "This must be the vial that was stolen from there."</p>

<p>Theron turned his attention back to the paramedics. "How are the reporters?" he asked. "Are they all right?"</p>

<p>"They're alive," answered one of the medics, "They'll recover."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Samantha and Dave were being attended by other paramedics and questioned by investigators. Dave told the authorities how Theron had helped them towards the end of the ordeal by cutting their ropes and showing them the way out. Samantha, despite the onset of laryngitis, whispered her affirmation that Theron felt regret of everything and had told them that he himself was trapped. The police investigators told the pair that this was going to be taken into consideration at the time of Theron's trial, and they would ask the judge for leniency. They also told them that Denise Ralston had been captured fleeing on a highway, and that they might never have located her if not for the Channel 8 news helicopter spotting her car from the sky.</p>

<p>Ulrich was declared dead on the scene.</p><h3>Chapter 27 - Diplomatic immunity</h3>

<p>The city was in a whirlwind of activity. The news was out about the governor's corruption, illegal business arrangements, and his death. Amid the noise and rushing about, Conway had picked up Mabel and the two had driven over to the TV station. They found Ted just as he was leaving.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ulrich," the news editor said, surprised, "I'm sorry about your husband passing. I heard it was a combination of the electrical shock and fright that caused a heart attack."</p>

<p>"Please call me Mabel," she answered, "Maybe it sounds a bit cold, but there's an old saying that people reap what they sow. In any event, he was a bad man, Ted."</p>

<p>"How are Samantha and Dave?" Conway jumped into the conversation, as he bent down to pet his dog Zachary.</p>

<p>Ted walked out the door, holding it open for them and said, "They're at the hospital, hurt but alive. I'm headed there now."</p>

<p>"We'd like to come, if you think that's ok," Mabel added.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure that'll be ok," answered Ted.</p>

<p>They all headed to the parking garage, Ted to his car and Conway, Zachary and Mabel to theirs, but before they could drive away, a Channel 8 news van drove up. As the reporter, Todd, and the cameraman got out of the vehicle, two familiar looking cats hopped out with them. It was Geronimo and Roxanne.</p>

<p>Ted opened the car door for Geronimo and the tomcat leapt inside.</p>

<p>"Take me to the hospital, Ted" said the cat.</p>

<p>"Exactly where I'm headed," he answered, driving off.</p>

<p>"Roxy!" Mabel exclaimed, picking up her cat and holding her close, "I was so worried about you. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story, madame" the cat said, "I'll tell you soon."</p>

<p>Conway smiled at them, and his dog Zachary, who was in the back seat, barked with joy.</p><hr>

<p>Across town, Samantha and Dave were admitted to hospital; Dave insisting that he be in the same room with Samantha. She received treatment for the burns that the electrical shocks had left on her hands and arms, with a topical ointment that not only facilitated healing but left no scars. While Samantha was being examined, another doctor checked Dave. He had a bruise on the side of his face that would heal on its own, and since he had been punched in the ribs, it was difficult for him to move quickly without feeling pain; however, there were no bones broken, only cracked, and this could also heal on its own. The doctor recommended at least two weeks rest for both Samantha and Dave, and they were told they would recover soon.</p>

<p>"Ms. West was extremely lucky," explained a doctor, "The electric shock of 100 milliamps might've killed her if it had happened at the time her heart was partially constricted, because the heart would've been forced to close instead of opening. The heart's rhythm would be disrupted and a heart attack typically follows."</p>

<p>After they were stable in their rooms, Leandra, Samantha's sister, called the hospital and was relieved to find Samantha was alive and was able to whisper "hello." A series of visitors and well-wishers also paraded through, Ted being one of them, carrying a purring Geronimo which he put on Samantha's bed. The cat curled up beside Samantha and purred even louder.</p>

<p>"You guys have a knack for getting yourselves into trouble," their editor said.</p>

<p>"Occupational hazard," Samantha whispered with a small smile.</p>

<p>"The whole newsroom sends 'Get Well Soon' wishes," Ted told them. "The entire region seems to be in an uproar over what Ulrich was doing, and they are grateful to you two, in particular, for the revelation."</p>

<p>"That's great, Ted." said Samantha, "I can't wait to get out of here so that I can finish the report."</p>

<p>"Are you kidding? You need a vacation first," replied Ted.</p>

<p>“I promise we’ll take a vacation, but we at least want to do the follow-up,” said Samantha.</p>

<p>“We’ve been working on this report for so long,” added Dave. “This is our story and we’d like to see it to the end.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” replied Ted, “you <em>will</em> do the follow-up, but the doctor said to rest for several days. The Longguo ambassador has been ordered deported and the Sarrillian prime minister just announced diplomatic relations with that country have been severed. Are you sure you can report impartially on this?"</p>

<p>“Yes,” Samantha and Dave said emphatically and simultaneously.</p>

<p>Ted smiled and nodded his head.</p><hr>

<p>That night at the hospital, Samantha tossed and turned. Dave was with her in the room and he went to her, shaking her awake gently.</p>

<p>"Samantha, it's me; it's all right," Dave said. He held her comfortingly, and she moved closer to him.</p>

<p>"Dave," she said, her voice still a whisper, "We were back in that torture chamber..."</p>

<p>"It's only a nightmare, Sam," he replied. They were both silent for a moment. Samantha was shivering.</p>

<p>"It's freezing in here," Samantha murmured.</p>

<p>"You have a fever," Dave told her gently. "The nurse said it's 102. She said she was coming back with medicine to lower it."</p>

<p>They sat there together, holding each other in silence, until a nurse came in bringing a tray with medicine.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're awake. Good. You need to take this to lower your temperature," she said, handing Samantha a small paper cup with a pill in it. "Do you want to swallow it with water or juice?" the nurse asked.</p>

<p>"Water is fine. Thank you," answered Samantha.</p>

<p>After taking her medicine, Samantha lay down again, Geronimo the cat snuggling close to her. Dave stroked her hair until she fell asleep again and then he lay down in his own bed, feeling exhausted but at peace.</p><hr>

<p>Three days later, Samantha and Dave had both recovered sufficiently to leave the hospital. It was also the day when the Longguo ambassador was scheduled to leave Sarrilla. Both countries had cut diplomatic ties and Ambassador Qiang Xue had been declared <em>persona non grata</em> on Sarrillian land.</p>

<p>Samantha's arms were still bandaged from the electro-shocks, and Dave was still bruised; nonetheless, they went to the airport to cover the event.</p>

<p>The wind was chilly, but the snow had entirely melted and the trees were beginning to sprout the buds of leaves. They set up their camera and tripod on the tarmac with the other journalists; Samantha was giving a live report. They had managed to get a position right in front of the stairs leading up to the airplane entryway.</p>

<p>Upon seeing two large wood crates being loaded onto the airplane, a newspaper reporter piped up:</p>

<p>"What's in the crates?"</p>

<p>"No comment," snapped one of the diplomats.</p>

<p>"Furs?" asked another.</p>

<p>"No comment!"</p>

<p>The thought irritated Samantha. No one had found the fox furs that they had filmed at the warehouse. It was likely that Ambassador Qiang had taken the furs back to the embassy while she and Dave were chloroformed. In fact, the crates being loaded onto the airplane looked like those exact crates with the fox pelts. There was nothing anyone could do; under international law, just as the ambassador had diplomatic immunity which allowed him to walk out of Sarrilla unpunished, the baggage could not be inspected.</p>

<p>Ambassador Qiang was the last to board the airplane, parading past the line of television cameras with a smug air about him. Samantha and Dave tried to hide their anger.</p>

<p>He paused as he reached where they stood, and, almost as an afterthought, reached into his coat pocket and retrieved two items: Samantha and Dave's press ID cards.</p>

<p>"I believe these belong to you," Ambassador Qiang smiled.</p>

<p>Samantha took the press cards from him wordlessly. The other journalists there were snapping photographs and filming the moment; all the cameras trailed on the TV reporter and the corrupt diplomat. Dave, too, focused his camera on Samantha and Qiang, but there was the same disgust in his eyes as in Samantha's.</p>

<p>Without saying any more, the diplomat climbed the steps. Samantha and Dave could only watch as he entered the waiting airplane.</p>

<p>"He's getting away scot-free," said Dave. "He's the one who instigated everything, and he's the one who ends up going unpunished."</p>

<p>"He'll be punished someday," answered Samantha with conviction. "Our job was to reveal the truth."</p>

<p>Inside the airplane, as the propellers roared to life and it began coursing down the runway, Qiang looked out at Sarrilla's thawing spring landscape. He could see, sitting a distance away on a hill overlooking the airport, the two arctic foxes observing the aircraft as it departed southward to Longguo.</p>

<p>There was a shudder through the airplane. Qiang felt a chill course through his body and a sudden, unexplainable fear accompanied by a sense of deja vu. "This moment," he whispered to himself, "I dreamt of this moment last night...my death." His eyes grew wide with terror...</p>

<p>"<em>No</em>...!" he screamed.</p>

<p>On the tarmac, the other journalists had begun dispersing, but Samantha and Dave lingered. They had followed this story relentlessly, had nearly been killed for it, and so it was natural to them that they should remain until the airplane had vanished into the sky. Dave's camera was following the diplomat's airplane as it left, while Samantha, holding the microphone, was reporting:</p>

<p>"Once the airplane leaves Sarrillian airspace, diplomatic ties between Sarrilla and Longguo will officially be broken. As it heads off towards Longguo, it...it looks like there's smoke coming from the airplane."</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> smoke. Samantha stopped talking, lowering the microphone, and she and her cameraman watched as the airplane took a nosedive and spiraled down, colliding with the mountain cliff in an explosion of fire.</p>

<p>Samantha and Dave were speechless, their camera focused on the remnants of the airplane, as the other journalists rushed back. Everyone was talking at once, reporting on the air what had just occurred, but not Samantha and Dave. For the first time in their journalistic careers, they were so incredulous as to be at a loss for words. As the realization sank in, a smile crossed Samantha's face.</p>

<p>"Divine justice," she murmured.</p><hr>

<p>Miles away, the imperial palace of Longguo sprawled amidst a vast Asian garden. In a glass case inside the palace, a rattlesnake was coiled. The emperor was here, looking out one of the large palace windows at the surroundings, when another man stepped into the room. He was about 30, dressed in a suit, tie, and vest, and wearing sharp, rectangular glasses that framed an analytical gaze. There were two guards with him, along with a general, all in Longguo's formal military attire.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, your majesty," the man said, bowing.</p>

<p>"An unfortunate tragedy, Dr. Qiang Shui," the emperor told him, though he seemed impassive. "I wanted to be the one to inform you. The airplane your father was on, returning to Longguo from Sarrilla, crashed upon taking off. No one survived."</p>

<p>The ambassador's son stared at him in shock and appeared distraught. "...What? No, it can't be. Surely there must be a mistake...!"</p>

<p>"There is no mistake," the emperor said, still nonchalant.</p>

<p>"Those Sarrillian swine!" Shui exclaimed, his sorrow turning into anger, "They must have done something to the airplane. I shall see that whoever is responsible for this, will..."</p>

<p>"No, Doctor, you will have nothing to do with the situation." The emperor's stern command made him avert his gaze to the ground. "I will personally oversee the investigation of this tragic accident. I want you to place all your attention in your research. Your experiments are of the utmost value to the empire."</p>

<p>Shui said nothing; he took out a gold pocket watch and opening it, gazed in deep thought at the clock face. "The irony...bitter irony..." he said, unable to hide his emotion. "Do you know what I succeeded in doing in one of those experiments? One of my subjects had a fear of flying on airplanes. I eliminated it entirely."</p>

<p>The emperor frowned, and the general seemed amused. The emperor said, "Doctor, trifles such as that are useless for our purposes. I understand you are a scientist but you shouldn't let yourself get overly enthusiastic."</p>

<p>"Yes, your majesty," he replied, ever more disheartened.</p>

<p>"The ones to blame for your father's death are the two Sarrillian journalists who began looking at our fur trade business," the emperor stated. "If it weren't for them, your father would never have gone on that airplane, and he might well be alive. Think of that when you do your research."</p>

<p>The rattlesnake began shaking its tail, creating a harsh noise. Shui closed the pocket watch and put it away, glancing at the snake. "What are their names?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Samantha Verity West and David Candid."</p>

<p>The scientist was pensive. The emperor dismissed him with a gesture, and he bowed and left.</p>

<p>The general lingered, and when the ambassador's son was gone, the emperor turned to look outside again and scoffed:</p>

<p>"He must not be told we sabotaged the plane. Revolt always begins by truth, and is often fueled by vengeance."</p>

<p>The general bowed low, and said, "Your majesty, I bow down before your greatness to request the privilege of asking a question."</p>

<p>The emperor gave him a sideways look. "Speak."</p>

<p>"Wasn't Ambassador Qiang loyal?"</p>

<p>"The ambassador was loyal, but not astute," explained the emperor, turning back to the window. "I was earning billions from the sale of those furs. It was a most profitable enterprise. He failed in hiding the business arrangement, and he failed in killing those two journalists when he had the chance. Failure is inefficiency."</p><h3>Chapter 28 - Springtime</h3>

<p>The day after the airplane crash, Samantha and Dave went to the newsroom, where, as they had insisted, put the finishing touches on their script and edited the report. The news about the poaching and the corruption had long since been reported around the world, but as they had said before to their editor, it was their story; hence, they were given a half-hour after the evening news for their investigative report plus a segment where Ted interviewed them about their ordeal. Roxanne the cat was also interviewed, this time on-the-record without fear of showing her identity.</p>

<p>Samantha had secretly thought that, although it meant a great deal to both her and Dave to be able to report this, not many viewers would tune in since it was already old news. A month later, she would be pleasantly surprised to learn that their investigative story received the highest ratings ever in the network's history.</p>

<p>Before leaving for Tropical Island, Samantha and Dave appeared at court to testify on Theron's behalf. Theron told the entire story of how the poaching plot had begun, who was involved, and everything he knew. Venancio and Denise both pled guilty, and in so doing, Denise implicated the Vaharis police chief Meadows as one of the people Ulrich had told her to pay off with regional funds, and he was also arrested and tried.</p>

<p>Washburn testified about having been kidnapped and how they attempted to kill him, backing up the statements that Venancio had given about how he and Gorgonio were following Ulrich's orders.</p>

<p>The judge said he believed Theron deserved leniency and gave him one year in jail.</p>

<p>"What do you plan to do when you're released from prison?" Samantha asked him.</p>

<p>"I have no idea," Theron sighed. "But I know one thing...I don't want to stay around here. I've had enough of the Nortenya region."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ted, "if you ever end up on Tropical Island, you could drop by the WCAT television station. One of our lighting technicians is retiring soon. We could always use someone who knows enough about electricity and how the equipment works."</p>

<p>"But after all I've done," Theron said, surprised. "Part of the reason you almost died was because of me."</p>

<p>"No, part of the reason we <em>survived</em> was because of you," Samantha corrected.</p>

<p>Theron thanked them and said he would definitely consider applying there when he was free.</p>

<p>Conway and Mabel, along with their pets Roxanne and Zachary, had come to see the trial also. They had recently married and Mabel was pregnant. They were both beaming with happiness when Samantha went over to them, with congratulations and, ever the news reporter, had a few questions for the ranger.</p>

<p>"What are they planning to do with that fox stole, Denise had?" asked Samantha.</p>

<p>"They're going to auction it off," explained Conway. "The proceeds are going to go into a regional arctic fox breeding effort. The population has been decimated. They need all the help they can get. However, I think it’s safe to say that the arctic fox is not going to be plucked off of the endangered species list any time soon."</p>

<p>"That's good to hear," Samantha said.</p>

<p>As Conway and Mabel left, Dave spoke up, "Hopefully the proceeds really do go into helping arctic foxes, and not just into yet another corrupt politician's wallet."</p>

<p>"Devon has two reporters assigned to track where the money goes, just in case," Ted grinned. "If it doesn't end up with the foxes like it should, we have headlines."</p>

<p>"Well," Samantha said, "a new election has been scheduled a month from now. I guess we'll see what happens."</p>

<p>From the court building, Samantha, Dave, and their editor Ted returned to the newsroom to bid farewell to their Vaharis colleagues. They were given a standing ovation by everyone there.</p>

<p>Afterwards, they went to the airport to head back to Tropical Island. Geronimo was put in a carrier for the flight and brought on board with his humans, accommodations which - although he refused to admit it - were more comfortable than the cramped camera bag he had arrived in.</p>

<p>Ivan and Natasha, perched atop a hill, waved their tails at the journalists as they boarded the airplane. Their winter coats were beginning to shed, leaving them a grey-brown color with streaks of white. Clustered at their paws were three grey fluff-balls, their new litter of fox kits, who yapped goodbye as the airplane flew off towards the Caribbean.</p><hr>

<p>A month passed and Samantha and Dave had fully recovered physically from their ordeal. They were in the middle of their vacation when they received word that - on account of their risky investigative journalism and exemplification of the profession's ethics - they had been selected as the winners of the journalism award known as the Ribbon of Truth. It was something that overjoyed both the reporter and her cameraman.</p>

<p>They were also pleased to hear that Nortenya had elected Egan Irving as their new governor, a man everybody knew loved and respected nature.</p>

<p>Geronimo’s parents, Tifarah and Butch, were overjoyed to learn that their son played a major role in rescuing their humans. Geronimo was no longer a kitten.</p>

<p>Leandra, Laurence, Tifarah, Butch and everyone who knew Samantha and Dave made their way to the awards ceremony that sunny, warm morning.</p>

<p>It was to take place on the far side of Tropical Island, and the reporter and her cameraman decided to travel there via the WCAT news helicopter with Geronimo - who finally got to ride in the helicopter as he wanted - to accept the award. It was a beautiful day; the sun shone across the island, making the sea water glimmer and the buildings sparkle. Geronimo stood up on Samantha's lap, his paws pressed on the helicopter window and purring loudly. Samantha always liked the view from up here; the accident she had been in so long ago had not changed that. Nor had the ordeal that she and her cameraman endured on the mainland dimmed their passion for their career. If anything, it had made them even more determined as journalists. Dave held Samantha, and they both gazed out the helicopter window at the island from above.</p>

<p>At the awards ceremony, they each received a shimmering crimson-silk ribbon with a medal depicting a sun, which Ted as their editor bestowed on them. Geronimo also received a smaller version as a collar; recognition of his saving his humans and safeguarding the videocassette.</p>

<p>Yet...why did it feel as if a bigger story was beginning?</p>

<p><em>"By looking back on the world of yesterday, we gain knowledge that gives us a better understanding of the world of today. In so doing we see how the abuse of one leads to the abuse of all, and how the voice of one can end a winter of cruelty and corruption, and so, bring the warmth of spring. Seasons are a cycle, and winter may return, but there must and will always be a voice to speak up, the sun's rays to illuminate the darkness and thaw even the deepest and strongest permafrost. In many ways this is the greatest moral of our story; the immortal differences between dictatorship and freedom, ignorance and information, and the strong courage that drives people to seek the truth, even at the greatest risk, for with truth comes freedom. Reporting Live, Samantha West, WCAT 8 News; back to you."</em></p>
