<p>Archer is lost.</p>

<p>The last thing he remembers is being at a Team Rocket soireé. Now he's marooned on a semi-deserted island, with wildlife as familiar as they are distinct and a population that lives by the law of kill-or-be-killed.</p>

<p>He's starting to think he shouldn't have drunk that third martini.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an urban redevelopment plan in Lumiose City unveils a beautiful new vision...with mega-secrets, which might have more to do with Archer's exotic island than anyone could begin to imagine.</p>

<p>Archer Verdi swirled his drink around in the martini glass, so the festive lights decorating the parlor danced across the liquor, and decided it would be his last for tonight.</p>

<p>That was before they started talking about the damn woodchuck.</p>

<p>"There I was," hissed Meowth, the cream-furred cat arching his back for emphasis, "with my carton of milk, trapped between a stone wall and a savage Bidoof..."</p>

<p>"Oh Meowth, we've heard this story ten-million times," Jessie interjected.</p>

<p>"Yes, let me talk about my bottle cap collection now," James concurred.</p>

<p>Meowth bared his fangs at his two human friends in a little hiss. "Wait your turn."</p>

<p>Archer poured himself another drink. Beside him, his younger sister Kris chimed in excitedly, "I haven't heard the story about the Bidoof! What happened then, Meowth?"</p>

<p>Meowth continued regaling the tale with enthusiasm, while Archer excused himself and slipped away from their storytelling gathering to the rest of the party.</p>

<p>The soireé set an elegant stage for their organization's upper echelon and their high-society invitees to mill about in both business discussions and frivolous conversation. Archer did not want to be here. He probably wouldn't have come at all were it not for the request of his godfather, Team Rocket don Giovanni Delavita.</p>

<p>He could see Giovanni a distance away, talking with one of the planetary councilmen. Team Rocket was the world's most powerful crime syndicate, as influential as they were feared. The planetary council oversaw inter-regional government, yet the economy was Team Rocket's backstage, and Rocket Enterprises' recent monopoly in the manufacture of Poké Balls – the spherical pet carriers allowing trainers to shrink their animals down to size, and carry them about with ease – cemented their hold inflexibly. Pokémon were as essential to human civilization as they were invaluable companions, and practically everyone had one of the element-wielding animals if only for self-defence.</p>

<p>Archer himself was about twenty-nine in age. He was fairly easy to pick out from the crowd, with neatly combed teal-blue hair, tailored vest-suits, and refined manners that only hid deadly expertise as one of Team Rocket's admins; an elegant danger one might imagine of a high class thief or assassin. Working as one of Team Rocket's elites, of course, meant both descriptions were true. To that extent his colleagues James and Jessie could claim the same distinction, but they were casual in their way – by design, they'd told him, preferring to be more down-to-earth and catch their enemies unaware when they showed their true natures.</p>

<p>Perhaps the experiences Archer kept to himself had bestowed on him a more incisive way of approaching things, though he personally felt nothing good could have come out of past traumas.</p>

<p>"Must be an enigmatic thought that you're swirling in your mind," a feminine voice broke his thoughts. Archer looked up.</p>

<p>Standing before him was Mrs. Jett Silph from the Kalos region. She was at least fifty, blonde and fair with sky-blue eyes; the picture of old money through and through. Her husband had been the former CEO of the Silph Company, though upon his passing she had left Kanto and moved to Kalos, where she'd invested into acquisition of a then-fledgling land development company known as Quasartico Inc.</p>

<p>An unfailing prim and proper bearing belied sharp business sense. Jett had shown herself to be an astute investor, as well as shrewd in widening her connections, and had grown Quasartico's prominence and profit alike since she'd become its head. Her latest project was ostensibly less for profit and more of "giving back to the community" as she ostentatiously put it; Quasartico had gotten the contract for an urban redevelopment plan for Lumiose City, the largest city in the Kalos region, with the goal of bringing more wide swathes of parkland into civic areas for Pokémon to thrive. Archer didn't know much about it. He presumed it was one of those philanthropic gestures intended to make her company look good to the public.</p>

<p>"Some things need to be thought over," was Archer's reply; frankly he was not motivated to talk to a person who was almost a stranger about his personal issues.</p>

<p>"Don't think too much, honey," she said amicably, "sometimes one gets stressed out."</p>

<p>Archer gave her a slight smile back as protocol but answered nothing.</p>

<p>Jett stepped away and walked over to a group of people mingling around the buffet table; she immediately put on a bright smile and immersed herself in whatever conversation they were having. <i>She sure has her socializing technique perfected,</i> he thought.</p>

<p>He felt a sudden boredom, and stepped away from the parlor.</p>

<p>Archer retreated out to the veranda. The faraway hooting of a Noctowl lent charm to that rural area where Giovanni's elegant mansion was located; from here he could see the distant high-rises and glittering lights of the city proper, as well as the shimmering neon sign of Rocket Game Corner, their syndicate's flagship casino. Above an array of stars decorated the night sky with constellations, amidst which resided the crowning glory – the moon with its crescent-shape.</p>

<p>He stood and gazed up at it reverentially. A soft dusting of snowfall gently floated down to meet him. It was that early point of winter when the temperatures would only get colder from that point forth and the weather would eventually decide to blanket everything with white.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a flash as a Pokémon teleported in front of him – a little, letter-shaped creature with an eye, which floated before him with psychic ability. It was an Unown.</p>

<p>As he watched, more Unowns joined that one and squeaked at him in a chorus.</p>

<p>"<i>Unowns</i>? Here in Celadon City? Don't tell me you're the same group we've met before," Archer remembered. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>They responded with insistent squeaking, like they were all clamoring to talk at once. Archer, of course, could not speak Unown. However, the last time he'd met them they communicated by positioning themselves in the form of words.</p>

<p>"Can't you write what you're trying to say?" he prompted.</p>

<p>They all looked at each other. "Oh, there aren't enough of you here," Archer realized. He scrutinized the group and noticed a pattern in which Unowns were missing. "Where are all the vowels?"</p>

<p>More squeaking ensued.</p>

<p>Jessie and James emerged from the party, in each other's arms and whispering sweet-nothings like if they were the only people in the world. When Archer cleared his throat they looked up at him, the mood dampening considerably. "Archer. We didn't see you there." James sounded rather disappointed. "Hey...are those Unowns?"</p>

<p>"What are they doing here?" Jessie remarked.</p>

<p>"No clue. Where's Meowth?" inquired Archer.</p>

<p>"Having a fight with your sister's Eevee."</p>

<p>"Oh for the love of...is there another Pokémon here who can communicate with humans and could translate for us? Where's the boss' Persian?"</p>

<p>"Cheering on Eevee."</p>

<p>"Can't they write?" asked James, as the couple walked over.</p>

<p>Archer shrugged. "No vowels."</p>

<p>"That's no trouble," Jessie dismissed airily. "It's like playing a game of hang-man." She turned to face the Unowns, which were floating about ambivalently. "Spell what you can; we'll figure out what letters are missing. Now...where are the vowels?"</p>

<p>The Unown shifted their positions in mid-air to spell:</p>

<p>PLPGS SLND</p>

<p>"Do we have a...U?" guessed James.</p>

<p>One of the Unown gave a couple of sharp squeaks.</p>

<p>Archer watched this with skepticism. "Why can't one of you go interrupt the battle and bring Meowth out here?"</p>

<p>"Because he has sharp claws," Jessie replied straightforwardly.</p>

<p>To which Archer whirled about and headed towards the parlor. "I'll get my Houndoom to chase him out here."</p>

<p>The Unown drifted after him.</p>

<p>A small crowd had ringed around where Meowth and Eevee were facing off in a Pokémon battle.</p>

<p>Meowth pounced at his opponent, claws unsheathed, as the fluffy creature sprang fleetly back. Eevee was agile enough to dodge each one of Meowth's strikes; it angled one of its long ears back at its trainer for a directive.</p>

<p>"Eevee, Swift!" called Kris.</p>

<p>With a cry, Eevee let loose a barrage of gleaming energy shards. They went flying towards Meowth – <i>and</i> Archer, who had accidentally walked up at the precise moment and position to be in the line of fire.</p>

<p>"Archer look out!" Kris cried.</p>

<p>"Shit...!" Archer exclaimed, ducking aside.</p>

<p>The Unowns surrounded him at the same instant; there was a flash of light, and Swift shards pelted empty ground as all the spectators' attention diverted immediately from the battle.</p>

<p>The Unowns had vanished.</p>

<p>So had Archer.</p><hr>

<p>Bright tropical sunlight hit Archer instantly, so sudden it caused him to flinch his eyes away. What had happened? One second he'd been at the party; the next...</p>

<p>There was the sound of the seashore, and the murmured noises of wildlife. He opened his eyes blearily and was met with three rotund sheep Pokémon standing about him as if in awe of his appearance.</p>

<p>Wooloo.</p>

<p>They stood on their hind legs.</p>

<p>"Wait a sec..." Archer gave a double-take, and the three bipedal Wooloo, startled, bleated loudly and ran away. They scattered into the distant tall grass and trees.</p>

<p>Since when did Wooloo walk on their hind legs?</p>

<p><i>Maybe they taught themselves, like Jessie and James' Meowth,</i> reasoned Archer, who thought no more of it as he glanced around the beach and the shimmering ocean horizon. The sun was unbearably hot, especially in comparison to the snowy climate he'd been in mere moments ago.</p>

<p>Nothing there looked familiar at all. "Those damned Unowns," he muttered.</p>

<p>His first guess was he was somewhere in the Hoenn region. He'd based it on the tropical foliage and distant mountain peak which he presumed to be Mount Chimney, yet the moment he turned round he realized there was no way this was Hoenn.</p>

<p>It was a tall spire hewn of stone, atop which was inscribed a single, glowing Unown letter I – for international? interconnected? He couldn't imagine why an I.</p>

<p>There were no other manmade structures anywhere in sight, let alone architectural marvels such as this skyscraper in the midst of nowhere. As he neared the building, he could see something had been scrawled on the side wall like graffiti; it looked like it had been painted recently, yet it was written in Unown lettering:</p>

<p align="center"> <i>THE TOWER IS THE KEY<br />
THE TREES HOLD THE TRUTH</i> </p>

<p>Archer stared at it in wonderment.</p>

<p>On his belt, Houndoom's Poké Ball began shaking, and Archer pressed the center button to let the Pokémon out of the red-and-white sphere. Houndoom emerged in a flare of white light; it was a lean attack dog with black fur and antelopine horns, and a tapered tail that flared into a tufted arrow point of fur at the tip. It looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, then at its trainer with a quizzical whine.</p>

<p>"I don't know where we are either," Archer answered what he presumed it was asking him.</p>

<p>He began looking around the tower for an entry, only to halt when he heard a sizeable group of people coming up the trail.</p>

<p>In the same way as he'd been quick to presume his location, his first instinct now was relief. People meant answers and a way to contact home. Once again, that first impression of his was totally subverted.</p>

<p>They were shouting in a language Archer didn't recognize at all. Their attire was some strange mix of handmade boots and fingerless gloves, and a more modern-styled jumpsuit with a cowl.</p>

<p>They also had guns.</p>

<p>The latter part didn't escape notice, least of all when they began shooting at him. Archer ducked down as Houndoom bolted in front, sending out a shimmering energy barrier to shield them both. The bullets struck the force field and harmlessly bounced off.</p>

<p>Houndoom's Protect was successfully blocking the gunfire; however, Archer knew it couldn't be sustained for long. The moment the men stopped shooting, both out of bullets and seemingly confused, Archer sprang to take the advantage.</p>

<p>"Inferno!" he called, and Houndoom dutifully unleashed an explosive wave of fire. It burst from its jaws towards the ground spreading outward and their enemies yelled and haphazardly tried to evade. A few fell to the ground, trying desperately to put out flames that now clung to their clothes.</p>

<p>Archer's vengeful delight at having the upper hand was short-lived. He could see them reloading their guns.</p>

<p>"Houndoom, return," ordered Archer, recalling his Pokémon to its capsule in a flash of red light. Then he ran.</p>

<p>The jungle was not too dense; there were paths between the trees, and creeks narrow enough to bound over easily. Training kicked in from years back, when he was newly rising in Team Rocket rank, and he might have been able to maneuver deftly about the landscape for some time were it not for a poor twist of fate.</p>

<p>A sharp pain pierced his arm; Archer stumbled and ducked behind a tree. Almost immediately he started to become faint, and he realized it was a poison dart.</p>

<p>"Fuck..."</p>

<p>He could barely curse his pursuers, or his ill fortune, or those blasted Unown again for teleporting him here, before darkness quickly overtook his vision and he collapsed into unconsciousness.</p><h2>Chapter 2 - A Piece of Cake ✅</h2>

<p>Archer stirred gradually, unsure how long he'd been asleep and not feeling rested at all. On the contrary, he felt ill. <i>Talk about a hangover. What a horrible nightmare...</i></p>

<p>Then he heard the sounds of people and activity around him.</p>

<p>His eyes snapped open and immediately he'd leapt to his feet, nearly reeling over from vertigo. He was in a large metal cage, with barely a couple of paces to walk in either direction, in the center of an encampment.</p>

<p>It hadn't been a nightmare. He really was God-knows-where and a captive.</p>

<p><i>Captive.</i> It brought back memories; awful memories, which sent a shiver coursing through his body with the horrifying thought of having to possibly re-experience a past ordeal.</p>

<p><i>Calm down. You've got to figure out a way to escape; you can do that better if you're not in a turmoil. Getting terrified will get you nowhere,</i> he told himself, as if it could somehow convince his frantic mind to cooperate. At least he was determined not to show his fear, that much was a given, however it made internalizing it all the worse.</p>

<p>His captors were scattered about the site, some guarding the periphery with their rifles, others milling about a campfire discussing something in the unknown language Archer had heard them speaking before. That was a further frustration to his plight. If he only knew what they were saying, at least he wouldn't feel at such a disadvantage – beyond, of course, the general indignity of being trapped in a cage.</p>

<p>He couldn't quite get over their duality, either. These people appeared both ancient and modern, as if contemporary attire and weaponry had met a primitive lifestyle and manner and adopted the worst characteristics of both. He caught a glimpse of red and noticed a couple of them examining a Poké Ball, which they tossed onto the ground. Being locked, it rolled without opening, and they snatched it back up with evident confusion.</p>

<p><i>They don't seem to realize how to unlock Houndoom's Poké Ball,</i> Archer thought with satisfaction, <i>With a little luck that'll keep them busy till I can break out of here. Assholes, stealing my Pokémon...especially when I'm the one from Team Rocket.</i></p>

<p>No one was really paying attention to him, or at least they seemed not to be. Archer began trying to devise a way to unlatch the door. He'd soon determined the lock needed a special key, and was trying to figure out who among these barbarians might have it – if he could lure them close on some pretense, maybe he could pickpocket it – when he startled at a motion that came into view in the edge of his sight, outside of the cage bars.</p>

<p>She was perhaps only a couple of years younger than he, and wore a black, hand-sewn leather jacket and skirt, as well as a cloth shirt painted with a jagged pattern. She had pink hair with a swath of ebony she'd combed off to the side, soft features he thought far too delicate for the savage ways of her peers, and violet eyes he could easily have likened to amethysts – they had the same translucency and brilliant depths.</p>

<p>The woman said something to him in the strange language. To Archer it was unintelligible.</p>

<p>"I really wish I knew what you were saying. Please get a translator," he grumbled with annoyance, "or a key to unlock the fucking cage."</p>

<p>Her eyes flew open wide. "You speak the ancient language?"</p>

<p>Archer immediately glanced up at her, gratified to hear her speaking as he did. "Finally, someone who understands me! Look, there's got to be a misunderstanding. I was teleported here by a bunch of wild Pokémon."</p>

<p>"Pokémon?" echoed the woman.</p>

<p>"Pokémon. Animals."</p>

<p>"Oh – Pals!"</p>

<p>"Well, they can be pals, I guess," Archer conceded, "The point is they sent me here, then your group ambushed me and stole Houndoom..."</p>

<p>"Houndoom," the woman interjected, "is that your Rayhound?"</p>

<p>"My dog," Archer replied.</p>

<p>"I've never seen a Rayhound that uses fire attacks. None of us in the Syndicate have."</p>

<p><i>They call themselves a syndicate?</i> thought Archer skeptically, reflecting on how the pressed suits and uniformed attire of Team Rocket agents would stand in contrast to these guerillas.</p>

<p>"None of us have seen a red and white Pal Sphere either. Or one that won't open whenever someone throws it," she went on, apparently referring to the Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"It's locked by magic," he said, half as a joke, half in a genuine attempt to bluff them into thinking he was a sorcerer or something and letting him go, like he'd seen in an old film somewhere where the hero was captured by natives.</p>

<p>She didn't bat an eye either way. "I'm the tower guardian. Besides that my father was the Syndicate boss," she told him. "Before that, his father was boss, and his father's father..."</p>

<p>"You said 'was'..." Archer interjected, "Who's the boss now?"</p>

<p>"No one yet. I was an only child so I'm next in line, technically..." Her reply trailed off a bit.</p>

<p>"If you're the heir apparent you can let me go, can't you?" Archer pursued.</p>

<p>"It isn't so easy."</p>

<p>She spoke tersely, yet before Archer could say a word in response an idea appeared to alight in her eyes. "Wait right here."</p>

<p><i>Sure, why not? Where else would I go?</i> Archer thought, leaning against the bars of the cage as he watched her sprint away to talk to some of the elders.</p>

<p>They had a vociferous discussion. Archer couldn't understand any of it, but it was evidently contentious. Finally, the woman returned.</p>

<p>"They won't let you go."</p>

<p>Archer pressed his head against the bars.</p>

<p>"They say you're an outsider," the woman added. "Unless you're part of our Syndicate, you're an enemy."</p>

<p>"Can't they make me an honorary member of the Syndicate and let me go? Honestly I don't want to start any kind of trouble; your group attacked me, not the other way around. I'd just as soon take my Pokémon and get out of here."</p>

<p>"Where will you go?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"Home."</p>

<p>"Where is your home?"</p>

<p>"Away from here," Archer said, "that much I can tell you! What are they planning to do with me, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Feed you to Faleris."</p>

<p>"Of all the fucking... What the hell is a Faleris?"</p>

<p>"The great fire-falcon that belongs to the island ruler. In return for not destroying our encampment and providing us with grain, he demands tribute every month in the form of a meal for Faleris. Hunting has been bad for us this season... You know, you can't get out that way," she added with nonchalance when she saw him tugging desperately at the bars.</p>

<p>"Well I don't exactly intend to sit still and be Poké-food," he snapped.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" she asked.</p>

<p><i>What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What's she getting at?</i> "There's no one else with me," Archer replied. "If there was, I can assure you, your ragtag group of guerrillas would all be in deep shit right now." A thought occurred to him and he glanced back up at her. She was still watching him with those doelike violet eyes. "Look, if you're asking would anyone miss me, that's not the point. Is there a reason why you can't find some other shmuck to feed to the bird?"</p>

<p>"You're not part of our Syndicate."</p>

<p>"If you make me part of the Syndicate, I'll find a way to drive off Faleris and his owner so you won't have to worry about them anymore."</p>

<p>"Drive them off?" she exclaimed, astonished. "Centuries ago, many tried to overthrow the island rulers and none ever succeeded. In modern days no one's ever dared. We've never seen any Pal strong enough to defeat Faleris."</p>

<p>"You'd never seen a fire type Houndoom, either. I'll handle them, but you people have to let me out of here first. <i>Capisce</i>?"</p>

<p>She gazed at him quizzically, and he clarified, "Understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," she said tentatively, "but I'll have to convince the others."</p>

<p>"Please try. As soon as you can," Archer urged her. He didn't want to spend a minute longer there.</p><hr>

<p>Archer tried every possible manner he could think of to get out of the cage by himself. He was about ready to give up when around sunset the cage was suddenly unlocked and his captors motioned him out at gunpoint.</p>

<p>He was led to a long wooden table they'd placed in the middle of their encampment, around which it looked like the entire group was congregated as if in expectance. The woman with the pink hair was here too, fidgeting with unease. <i>Great,</i> Archer thought pessimistically, <i>it's not enough they want to feed me to a man-eating Pokémon, they actually set a table for it.</i></p>

<p>When he got nearer he noticed that in the center of the table was...a cake.</p>

<p>It was a rather plain cake, but it looked rather out of place there nonetheless. A berry was placed atop it, of a variety he didn't recognize, and the frosting looked more like thick cream. Before he could make some kind of sarcastic comment about whether the dessert would pair well with the intended main course, the lady whispered to him with urgency.</p>

<p>"If you wish to live, cut a piece of cake and offer it to me."</p>

<p>He looked first at her, then at the stern faced militants all clutching their weapons and glaring at him as if this was their ultimatum. <i>What the hell,</i> Archer decided, and proceeded without comment to cut a slice of cake.</p>

<p>It was only when she accepted the piece from him that a jubilant cry rang out across the whole group, and Archer gave her a worried, questioning, look.</p>

<p>"Welcome to our Syndicate," she said with a coy smile.</p>

<p>He smiled back, a little nervously, but at least they didn't seem to want to kill him anymore.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent in a happy party, with everyone there dancing and singing into the lateness of night, and Archer went along with it, even when he was shoved towards the pink-haired lady so they could dance together. He realized he still didn't know her name, but figured it hardly mattered, considering he just needed to find a good moment to grab Houndoom's Poké Ball and discreetly slink away now that she'd gotten him free. They didn't let him out of their sight, to his chagrin.</p>

<p>There was still something amiss going on; Archer couldn't place it, but he could sense it in the way the group regarded him – and her.</p>

<p>He started to realize what was going on when they pushed them together into a tent alone and shut the door flaps tight, while the rest of the people continued their revelry outside.</p>

<p>Archer looked at the woman expectantly.</p>

<p>She was seated on the elaborately decorated bedding that had been laid out on the ground, bearing an almost apologetic look. "We're a little bit married now."</p>

<p>Archer stared at her, only stared, till he finally blurted out:</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'a little bit married'?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't take over the Syndicate as boss unless I married," she explained, "and as the tower guardian I could only marry someone who spoke the ancient language. You were going to be killed unless you were accepted into the Syndicate, and the only way an outsider will be accepted is if they take a spouse from within..."</p>

<p>"I get it," he cut her off tersely.</p>

<p>She said nothing else and he sighed, deciding he'd been a bit too caustic with her when, all things considered, at least he was still alive. He sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"If I've got a wife, I ought to know her name."</p>

<p>"Zoe Rayne."</p>

<p>He imagined from the islanders' language she'd have a name unpronounceable to him, or at least something overly exotic. Her name sounded like something he'd easily have heard back home.</p>

<p>"I ought to know my husband's name too," Zoe ventured.</p>

<p>"Archer Verdi."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Archer, pretending you were my secret suitor visiting me from the nearby town and that we wanted to get married was the only way I could think of to get us both out of a bind."</p>

<p>"The problem is, I'm not going to be staying around. I have a life outside of this island."</p>

<p>"You said you were alone."</p>

<p>"Unattached, yes. But I have friends and family and property that I'm not about to just up and forget." He glanced at the bedding and pillows; they all had a uniquely bohemian design, with jagged lines interspersing mandala patterns, and depictions of a rare kind of lizard Pokémon probably a little too risqué for the Kanto region. "Why is everything here painted with well-endowed pink Salazzle?"</p>

<p>"What are Salazzle?" inquired Zoe.</p>

<p>He motioned to the fabric. "The lizards."</p>

<p>"They're symbols of fertility throughout Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>"Is that where we are? ...Palpagos Island?" He'd never heard of the place.</p>

<p>"You have different names for things," Zoe observed. "Like referring to Pals as Pokémon. The Pal Spheres you have are different...even your Pal is different."</p>

<p>"Because I'm not from this island. I need to get back home."</p>

<p>"Legends say there are people just like us across the ocean, who use different tools than we and live in harmony with Pals."</p>

<p>The way his heart leapt to hear that was immeasurable. It was the first good news he'd heard yet. She quickly stifled his joy.</p>

<p>"That's all they are," Zoe told him. "Legends."</p>

<p>"How can you be sure?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>"There is nothing beyond the sea," she insisted. "Those who have tried to make the voyage never return. The ocean is said to plummet into red fire."</p>

<p>"You're talking like the planet is flat. No one's believed that since prehistoric times. Haven't you ever flown up high on a bird Pokémon – er, Pal – and seen the horizon?"</p>

<p>The blank look on her face spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"No bird is strong enough to go that high! If you try, you'll both perish in the sun," she replied, echoing a tale Archer recalled having once heard as a prehistoric myth from some faraway region. "Besides, in any event, trying to fly beyond the sea is outlawed."</p>

<p><i>Outlawed? Now we're getting somewhere,</i> thought Archer, who was cynically starting to piece together something about the island's state of affairs. "Who outlawed it?"</p>

<p>"The island rulers...the PIDF."</p>

<p>"The PIDF?"</p>

<p>"The Palpagos Island Defense Force. Colonel Marcus' men."</p>

<p>Archer smirked at such a trite name for their army. It seemed to him Team Rocket had a better ring to it. At least it was more honest in its way of implying lofty aspirations than acting like they were actually there to <i>defend</i> anything. "They must have a leader. What's the guy's name?"</p>

<p>"Marcus Dryden."</p>

<p>Again, the name sounded unexceptional. "Who appointed him leader?"</p>

<p>"The commission."</p>

<p>"Who appointed the commission?"</p>

<p>"Marcus Dryden."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Dryden is basically the island king because he decided to be, and he tells you he'll destroy your village unless you feed his bird a snack every month, and on top of that no one can leave the island."</p>

<p><i>Team Rocket could probably mow down this banana republic and take it for ourselves,</i> thought Archer, as they deferentially settled down on opposite sides of the bedding for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>The idea of Team Rocket seizing an island territory that it seemed not even the planetary council knew of was entertaining yet inconsequential at present. He had worse problems at hand; he had to find a way off said island to get home. Zoe had mentioned a 'nearby town' hadn't she? If there was a town somewhere, and a ruling government – even if they were some kind of dictatorship – then perhaps they had the means to travel to or contact other regions, if only for themselves.</p>

<p>After all, they wouldn't prohibit leaving the island unless they knew what lay beyond the sea to begin with.</p><h2>Chapter 3 - The Quasartico Connection ✅</h2>

<p>Civilization held no finer regency than in historical Lumiose City.</p>

<p>Quaint shingled businesses and ornate two-story apartments lined boulevards that stretched in a wide, circular pattern towards a meeting point in the center plaza, where the graceful pillar of Prism Tower stood. At least half of the city's buildings bore historical designation, dating all the way back to the region's renaissance period. They were a peculiar blend of aristocratic charm with casual beauty, distinctly Kalosian in their architectural design.</p>

<p>For Jett, whose company had been tasked with bringing about a <i>new</i> renaissance period for the region, they were abhorrent. Privately, of course; she would never say so or admit it in public. It was less fault she found with the design as it was the fact her development project had to work around them. Many of the landowners could not be prevailed upon to sell, but even when they did, getting permits to demolish buildings with historical designation was next to impossible.</p>

<p>From her penthouse office in the modern-styled headquarters of Quasartico Inc. she could see most of Lumiose City at a glance. Her plans had already taken shape, to develop sprawling parks that would wind like miniature wild routes through the city, and by nightfall organize a vibrant battling tournament to take place on rooftop stadiums. With the city council's approval, she already had free rein for this much at least.</p>

<p>All of this would turn a profit, one way or the other. If the cost of planting a tree was one-hundred dollars, they would charge five-hundred. The proper maintenance of routes for wildlife habitat and easy hunting could be costly, and if Quasartico Inc. was appointed to oversee it within city limits that amount would be funneled accordingly. Pokémon battle tournaments always drew a gambling crowd, too.</p>

<p>Now only if she could get the damn demolition permits.</p>

<p>However, Jett was not one to accept no for an answer, nor one who would hesitate at what necessity wrought.</p>

<p>All these things swirled like a tempest in her mind as she gazed out her office window that drizzling morning. She would give them one final opportunity.</p>

<p>Within the hour, Jett was arriving to a meeting at City Hall. All the members of the city council were eager to discuss the various agendas they had. Before long, however, they were all embroiled in argument.</p>

<p>"This happens every time I bring up my points of discussion!" Jett argued, "I have plenty of money to turn this old, decrepit town into something marvelous and breathtaking, and the lot of you refuse to step into the future."</p>

<p>"It's not that we refuse to 'step into the future'," interjected a council member, "it's that we don't agree of your vision that this town is decrepit. It is old because it is historical, and that is reason enough to fix whatever is broken but not tear down buildings that have historical significance."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Jett interrupted, "Look at Prism Tower...it supposed to be one of the town's newer structures and even it has to be reinforced." Jett was getting noticeably irritated as she went on, "You can't even open the top of Prism Tower to tourists anymore, the top floor is one misstep away from a collapse and the rooftop garden is growing wild."</p>

<p>"Your company already has the contract for the largest-scale urban redevelopment project Lumiose has seen in years," a second councilman spoke, "Granting demolition permits for historically irreplaceable buildings should be off the table, because let's be frank, you may wish to reinforce Prism Tower but you've already stated less prominent structures should be bulldozed in the name of progress."</p>

<p>"In the name," said Jett emphatically, "of making a city that truly encapsulates both modern life and coexistence with Pokémon."</p>

<p>The head councilman struck his gavel to the table. "Enough! This argument is getting old. Time to vote on it... Show of hands please, who agrees with Mrs. Silph's position?" No one raised their hands in support and Jett felt her face flush. It was not from embarrassment but rather from intense anger. She was seething with fury.</p>

<p>"My apologies Mrs. Silph," said the head councilman, "but it looks as if you have failed to convince the members of this committee..."</p>

<p>He never got to finish his statement. Jett got up abruptly, gathered the papers she had brought with her and stuffing them into her briefcase, stormed away from the table. "You are all a bunch of idiots!" she yelled as she exited the room.</p>

<p>The others at the meeting looked at each other and said nothing, but the head councilman simply shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the situation. "That's been settled; let's discuss more urgent matters."</p>

<p>For Mrs. Jett Silph, however, it had not been settled. If they wouldn't oblige her in her request, then it would fall on a backup plan she'd already arranged for. The minute she returned to her office, she picked up the telephone on her desk and began dialling a number.</p>

<p>"...yes, I'm calling to ensure this week's shipment is ready to fly out. ...The same coordinates as always. Your discretion will be well paid."</p><hr>

<p>The drizzling rain subsided by mid-day and she left the office. She opened two Poké Balls and sent out two of her Pokémon: the poodle-like Furfrou, and a Clefable. They followed her cheerily as she strolled outside.</p>

<p>There was a white-and-red food truck that perpetually parked in a plaza off on the south side of Lumiose City, with a few tables scattered around for people to eat, and a beautiful view of a pond ringed with trees.</p>

<p>For all it looked like a casual eatery, it really wasn't. The food was gourmet and the prices matched. It did, however, create an outdoor gathering-place for Lumiose's executives and top citizens to get away from their office desks and meet informally at lunchtime.</p>

<p>Jett bought a croissant and went in search of the person she'd come here to meet. She spied him quickly, sitting at one of the furthest tables to the side of the little crowd.</p>

<p>Corbeau was thirty-five, always dressed in tailored black suits that complemented his lean physique, with round glasses framing sharp amber eyes and aubergine hair he kept short and combed to one side. He had taken over the Lumiose gym from the prior gym leader, Clemont, one year ago. Unlike his predecessor, Corbeau specialized in raising poison type Pokémon and presently ran the gym from within his private company headquarters.</p>

<p>It was his off-duty work that was questionable; as boss of the Rust Syndicate, he was a gym leader with underworld ties just like Giovanni in the Kanto region, and he likewise fancied his organization as powerful and as sinister as Team Rocket, however Jett knew that Corbeau's influence barely extended outside of Kalos. Still, Corbeau was someone the people of Lumiose knew to get along with, or at least not to fall afoul of if they wished to continue living, and as Jett was an artist in both tact and cordiality it was easy for her to cultivate a friendship with him.</p>

<p>They saw each other, and Corbeau motioned to the other seat at the table. She walked over and sat down.</p>

<p>"Heard you had a little jaunt to the Kanto region the other day," Corbeau mentioned.</p>

<p>"Networking opportunities. You know how it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know how it is. Of course, you still impress me. Taking up with the folks who murdered your late husband is something I didn't envision you as cold-blooded enough for."</p>

<p>Jett hesitated. "My marriage into the Silph family was more a matter of society...and it's not like <i>Mr.</i> Silph ever tried to pretend it wasn't."</p>

<p>She frowned pensively, for just a moment, yet shook away the recollections with her usual aplomb.</p>

<p>"I don't think Team Rocket would hold any disagreements they had with my late husband against me," she went on. "Giovanni owns the Silph Company now, and I haven't gotten in his way."</p>

<p>Corbeau nodded and replied, "Well, I have no dispute with Mr. Delavita. Our families have been on neutral terms for years, and so long as his Team Rocket stays out of Kalos it will remain that way. By the same token, my Rust Syndicate can't protect you on their territory. If it's up to me I'll keep the peace we have with them."</p>

<p>"I don't want war with them any more than you do," she said.</p>

<p>"I guess those supply shipments you're chartering out of the airport don't have a link?" Corbeau asked.</p>

<p>Corbeau's piercing amber eyes were watching her straightforwardly, and Jett briefly averted her gaze towards her food. She had her own topics to bring up and things to request, and here she now was trying to field his questions. <i>When did he ever find out about my chartered flights, anyhow?</i></p>

<p>"The one thing Giovanni was unable to get from the Silph Co. acquisition was what my late husband left me in secret," Jett tentatively confided, "a business connection far from any known region. They quietly provided Silph Co. with low-cost tumblestone and ore for Poké Ball manufacturing, and as payment they were quietly sent return shipments of certain items. I took over the business arrangement upon my husband's passing."</p>

<p>"Except you aren't in the Poké Ball business. No one except Team Rocket is since they monopolized the market," Corbeau replied.</p>

<p>"You have my word it has nothing to do with Team Rocket at all," Jett assured him. "The business liaison, in fact, is not even in Team Rocket territory. It's my own little business enterprise I have on the side...certainly you would be the last person to go against that?"</p>

<p>"I only care that it doesn't affect my own interests. So long as it doesn't, you have my every wish that you profit."</p>

<p>"On the matter of profit," Jett said, redirecting the conversation, "you're aware of my land development project with the city."</p>

<p>"Yes, although from what I heard you had a small disagreement with the city council this morning."</p>

<p>"Is there any way that your people can get me those demolition permits?"</p>

<p>"Not a chance."</p>

<p>"Mr. Corbeau, I know financial matters are as important to you as they are to me. If you're worried about the cost involved..."</p>

<p>"It's not that I don't want to help you. But even I know what we can and can't achieve."</p>

<p>"And Lumiose is so sacrosanct?" Jett replied.</p>

<p>When Corbeau's sole response was to give a disinterested shrug, Jett pursued the topic further:</p>

<p>"You can probably testify to the fact that Prism Tower needs work done. The gym was traditionally one of the establishments on the ground floor, and from what I understand the League approved your request to move from there on the spot when you showed the inspectors around."</p>

<p>He took a pensive sip of his coffee. "It's good business sense to welcome more wild Pokémon into the city. It means trainers hang around Lumiose longer, they spend money at the local marts, restaurants, Pokémon groomers... I know that means having to expand the park areas, and maybe we could do without some of the city's smaller structures, but I doubt they'll give you Prism Tower. That's a landmark."</p>

<p>Jett shook her head, allaying his concerns. "It's the <i>outlying</i> buildings that Lumiose doesn't need, in the historic and lower-class areas. Prism Tower can be renovated. We could probably finish that project in a year and a half, easily, so I really don't know what the city council want."</p>

<p>"It's just as well," replied Corbeau, "the city's only back-up power switch is atop Prism Tower. They probably don't want attention drawn to that."</p>

<p>This took her a moment to sink in. "Do you mean the entire Lumiose City power grid can be shut from the top of that crumbling building?"</p>

<p>"When the power plant outside Lumiose had that Magnemite problem some years back they thought it best to put a safety switch up somewhere that couldn't get hijacked by wild electric Pokémon. After all, what can get up there?" he smirked, "A Zapdos?"</p>

<p>"I shudder to ask how good the power lines are, then."</p>

<p>"Oh the electric infrastructure is fine. It's just the building that needs work. But you have your heart set on fixing that, I guess."</p>

<p>She returned a polite smile, and Corbeau glanced at his watch and stood. "I've got to get back to the gym. Good luck with the redevelopment plan."</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said as he left with his cup of coffee. She watched the gym leader stroll away down the sidewalk and turn the corner.</p>

<p>Jett went home afterwards, packed a bag and headed off to the ocean pier that housed her personal yacht. Her captain was waiting for her when she arrived, and the vessel sailed out of the harbor quietly.</p><hr>

<p>Fisherman's Point was a seaside town as ramshackle as the island's main settlement, with huts and narrow docks alike hammered together haphazardly out of wood. The smell of fish was inescapable here – be it cooked seafood, or freshly-caught, or drying out – though most of this bounty was handed off to the island leadership, leaving the residents to survive on berries, or catch food for themselves in secret. One of the town's saving graces was that it sporadically had electric power, due to one of the inhabitants having a couple of electric type Pals and a crude setup of transformers, and the PIDF guard assigned to oversee the town being willing to overlook it provided his house could siphon some electricity too. But this was only available during a couple of hours in the afternoon, due to the Pokémon only being able to exert themselves so much with their attacks and needing to recharge their energy.</p>

<p>Jett disliked how rustic it was. At least she had the yacht to provide her with the creature comforts she was accustomed to from the Kalos region, and two PIDF guards posted on the pier to keep curious locals at bay. She understood that they told the islanders this elegant and unusual boat was a government matter, and unless they wanted to fall afoul of the great commander Marcus Dryden they should keep a good distance. She never had any trouble, the few times she'd visited Palpagos Island.</p>

<p>For years her husband's family had quietly been sending shipments of crude oil and materiel to Palpagos Island in exchange for cheap tumblestone used in the manufacture of Poké Balls, and other such accoutrements; how the Drydens managed such cost-effective labor, the Silphs were astute enough not to ask, though they certainly availed themselves of it across generations.</p>

<p>Jett had consequently been introduced to Marcus Dryden, so he knew her already when she reached out via the usual channels. He'd expressed sincere condolences when Jett told him of her husband's passing, and been more than gracious when informed she would take over the shipments. When he heard that what <i>she</i> wanted in return was not material for Poké Balls, but something he'd been planning to do anyway – well, that made their alliance all the better.</p>

<p>Marcus arrived punctually at the agreed time. "Nice to see you again, Jett; hope you're well," he said.</p>

<p>Colonel Marcus Dryden was a tall man. Sandy blond hair complemented rugged features and brown eyes. The military coat he held over his shoulders as a cloak was partly woven of some kind of gold thread, and the ruff made of black fur.</p>

<p>"I am fine," she replied, "I did want to let you know the next drop is later this week."</p>

<p>"Good. I have the Pal you left here on your prior visit running a little task for me elsewhere, so that's why I didn't bring it along. ...I guess everything's uneventful over in Kalos?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jett smiled slightly to herself. "You have no need to be concerned over that. I assure you, there would be no difficulty at all, so long as you start at the southeastern side of Lumiose City, and aim straight at its heart."</p>

<p>Omission was a matter of expediency here, she reflected, a key to her unspoken strategy. A military strike on the mainland would surely lead nowhere, except maybe to Marcus Dryden's own demise...but it would get half of the city razed. And then Quasartico Inc. could rebuild Lumiose from scratch, and launder billions in the process.</p>

<p>"Yes, you've told me the southeast has the weakest defenses," said Marcus, returning her smile with a smirk of his own, "I still intend to launch my invasion of the Kalos region, but I'd like to make up for the wait you've endured. I have something new to show you; that is, if you're up to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am. What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's best if I show you in person."</p>

<p>He led the way out onto the ship's deck, with Jett recalling her Pokémon to their Poké Balls before following him. With a toss of a Pal Sphere, Marcus sent out his Faleris, which crowed loudly and flattened itself so they could both get on its back.</p>

<p>Faleris was a Corviknight. The bird was as imposing as its master, with the height of a dragon Pokémon and equally sharp yellow eyes, displaying brilliant red plumage instead of the black feathers Corviknight was known to possess. However, Jett knew all the island's wildlife were in some way unique in comparison to the Pokémon on the mainland, and the locals here referred to them by different names too.</p>

<p>Faleris took wing, towards the Astral Mountains; Jett hung on for dear life, but the flight was shorter than she'd expected. They landed amidst a desolate city on the mountainside.</p>

<p>Marcus helped her down and then led the way a short distance, eventually halting at what once had been an intersection with a decorative archway overhanging the street. He turned and gestured to the exotic red flowers growing in profusion along the cracked sidewalks and trying to climb the buildings.</p>

<p>They were small and scarlet, with three triangular petals tapered to a point adorned by black accents, and bearing what one could easily presume to be the stamen of the flower rising in the center like a steep pyramid. Leafy, dewy vines spread out around the blossom, covering the earth with green foliage; some of the flowers seemed to be trying to climb the walls, and those had grown as big as the palm of one's hand, though none had succeeded in the endeavor of scaling the buildings completely. Large herbivorous Pals in the area were grazing on them, keeping them in check.</p>

<p>"Well then, I recall you saying you needed something to beautify the road verges in Lumiose," said Marcus. "What do you think?"</p>

<p>Jett took one look at the flowers and gave a delighted gasp, exclaiming, "Marcus, they're beautiful!"</p>

<p>"I had a feeling you'd be pleased."</p>

<p>"What are they called?"</p>

<p>"Called?"</p>

<p>"Well the islanders can't merely call them 'beautiful flowers' can they? They must have a name."</p>

<p>He relented. "I believe they're known as Eternal Flowers. They're said to represent eternity...in one way or another."</p>

<p>"How do you care for them? Is there any specific amount of water or sunlight you have to provide them?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. They're hardier than they look. Plant them anywhere you like, and I guarantee they'll grow bigger than you expect."</p>

<p>She gladly accepted fifty pots of the flowers, and returned cheerfully to her development project in Lumiose City.</p>

<p>Marcus, in turn, left for his office at the island's main settlement, to wait. The horse had been delivered to Troy.</p><h2>Chapter 4 - Island Customs ✅</h2>

<p>The next morning, bright and early, the Syndicate members dragged Archer out of bed, returned Houndoom's Poké Ball, and half-guided half-shoved him to the exit of the camp. Archer couldn't believe his good fortune. They were really letting him go? Well, they were making Zoe come with him, anyway, but they were really <i>letting him go</i>?</p>

<p>"Technically we're on our honeymoon," Zoe explained, dampening his enthusiasm only a little. "We're expected to dwell for a time on the outskirts of the encampment, living off the land. On the new moon, we return."</p>

<p>"You have an awful lot of customs," remarked Archer, who was secretly scheming. The sooner he was out of their sight the sooner he could make a proper break for it.</p>

<p>Zoe was unusually quiet as they made their way across the landscape. She waited until they were reasonably far from the camp and Archer hesitated on a grassy hill, trying to figure out where to go next, before she spoke up.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll be heading on your way now."</p>

<p>He glanced sideways at her. "What happens if I do?"</p>

<p>"Well...I can't return to the encampment alone. If I did, we'd both be screwed."</p>

<p>"Both of us?"</p>

<p>"Me because they'd think I was defiled, you because they'll hunt you for sport."</p>

<p>"Zoe...dear..." he said hesitantly, "was there no other way to get me out of that cage other than your brilliant plan to get us hitched? You couldn't steal the key or maybe, I don't know, pick the lock?"</p>

<p>"None that'd solve both our situations at once," she replied blithely. "I always think the best thing is to kill two Chikipi with one stone."</p>

<p>Archer didn't know what the hell a Chikipi was, nor did he have any particular interest at this point in the island dialect – they evidently, he'd concluded, renamed half the Pokémon species and common items merely to spite him. He arbitrarily picked a direction and set off walking down the slope with Zoe in tow.</p>

<p>"You said you were the tower guardian," Archer remarked, when it became plain that she wouldn't leave, "Is that the same tower where your group found me?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"What's the place supposed to be for, anyway?"</p>

<p>"No one knows."</p>

<p>The response made him halt in his tracks. "Yet you guard it."</p>

<p>"We guard it, but no one remembers why we guard it," Zoe answered. "It's just there, and we're just here, so at this point why not?"</p>

<p>"God, I need to get back home," Archer muttered, and continued trudging across the grass. "Which direction is the nearby town?"</p>

<p>"A little less than two day's travel towards the sunrise."</p>

<p>"Two days?" he echoed. If that was the nearby town, he couldn't imagine how long it would take to reach the faraway ones. Figuring he'd best hurry his pace, he veered his course to head east. The sooner he reached the town, the sooner he might find some way to get home, or so he presumed.</p>

<p>The landscape was as beautiful as any route from the territories he knew of, only different. The tropical foliage bore countless unknown flowers, and familiar berries were painted with peculiar colors that made Archer stop and second-guess if they were the same kind of fruits at all. The animals, however, were the most striking. He caught a glimpse of two albino Eevee scampering into the bushes, a creature stretching in the sun that he thought at first glance was a Clefable before noticing its shorter Jigglypuff-like ears, and more of the bipedal Wooloo clustering in a herd.</p>

<p>At some point he stopped on a grassy hill to watch two wild elephants in a battle; what he knew as Copperajah, except these beasts were covered in a thick coat of leafy green fur. They were locking tusks and blasting each other with gleaming energy attacks and cascades of sharp-edged leaves.</p>

<p>"We call them Mammorest," Zoe explained, coming up to stand beside him, "they're grass types."</p>

<p>When the sky started darkening, they decided to set up camp for the night. They found a flat clearing partly ringed by trees, with enough space to easily lie beneath the sky, and collected branches to make a small campfire. Archer unlocked Houndoom's Poké Ball and threw it onto the grass, sending out the Pokémon, which gave a happy bark and spun about to light the pyramid of dry branches into a crackling blaze.</p>

<p>He then watched with interest as Zoe retrieved some Poké Balls of her own.</p>

<p>They were of the antique models that had a gold spire on either end, yet seemingly brand-new; the capsules appeared to be made not of apricorn but of tree bark, allowing the peculiar glow of the tumblestone lining that made all Poké Balls functional to permeate outside. When the light passed through the bark it appeared to be light blue, as opposed to the warmer tone he knew it emitted within.</p>

<p>Zoe gave the spheres a small toss into the air, and the creatures they held emerged when they struck the ground. One was a little blue penguin, which hopped over to Archer's ankles and gazed up at him; the other was a small green monkey with a leaf-tufted tail and a sprig of leaves on its head – pointed leaves, as opposed to the more rounded leaves Archer had seen this kind of Pokémon with in the past. He observed both animals skeptically.</p>

<p>"These are my Pals, Pengullet and Tanzee," Zoe introduced.</p>

<p>"That's a Piplup," commented Archer, "and that's a Pansage with a haircut."</p>

<p>"Pengullet's a water type. Tanzee's a grass type."</p>

<p>"So are Piplup and Pansage."</p>

<p>Piplup, or Pengullet, returned a happy cheep; apparently it didn't care what its name was one way or another. The Pansage, Tanzee, gave a screech as if offering its own views on Archer. He half-wished he could understand whether what it said was complimentary or disparaging; he had a feeling it was the latter.</p>

<p>Zoe spent time cooking some kind of meat over the open flame, which she had brought along from when they'd left the encampment and called 'broiled Dumud'. Archer wondered what the hell a Dumud was; when the food was done, he hoped the flavor would offer some insight. Instead, it tasted like a strange blend of Slowpoke with Krabby, something he didn't think he'd ever eaten before.</p>

<p>"It's good. Honestly with what little we've got for utensils and to season with...I'm impressed! You're a great cook." He continued eating. "What's a Dumud, anyway?"</p>

<p>"They look kind of like a blob with fins and a wide mouth," replied Zoe. "They live in the swamp mud around here. I don't know what you call them."</p>

<p>That sounded like...a Gulpin. Archer forced himself to swallow, having momentarily lost his appetite, before he forced the image away from his mind and resumed picking at the food. Evidently they weren't poisonous around here, but the thought of the slimy, muddy creatures wasn't palatable in the least.</p>

<p>"We have to make sure we avoid the wild Pals, the closer we get to the town," Zoe told him, "they can get very territorial around these parts."</p>

<p>"Houndoom can take care of them," dismissed Archer without a second thought. "I'm used to coming across wild Pokémon. They're commonplace where I come from."</p>

<p>"The world you came from must be far more dangerous than our island, then."</p>

<p>"Dangerous?" Archer quipped. "Only if you cross the wrong people. ...To tell you the truth there's not much to fear from the wildlife. You should always have an animal of your own before venturing into tall grass; however if it were that big a deal it wouldn't have become a rite of passage to set out travelling and collecting gym badges..." He realized what he was saying must sound unquestionably foreign when he noticed the perplexed yet interested look on her face, and he asked, "Isn't there anything similar here? Any kind of journey people usually go on with their pet upon coming of age?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "We learn to hunt and forage; however not even the townsfolk go on any sort of journey."</p>

<p>To Archer it seemed like a somber existence. He said nothing as he watched the sparks flicker off the campfire, the flames dancing in the night wind, and allowed his eyes to follow their graceful peaks upward to the sky and the familiarity he thought for sure he'd find there.</p>

<p>The stars were different, unrecognizable. The moon's crescent lay in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Archer only stared at the sight, and Zoe might have said something to which he didn't answer, because the next he heard was her prompting him, "...Archer?"</p>

<p>"People say Unown have strange abilities..." he said at last, "some that defy current understanding. I think they sent me through some sort of space or time warp or something."</p>

<p>Zoe gazed at him quizzically. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>Archer was briefly quiet. "It means I'm probably never getting back home."</p><hr>

<p>Archer and Zoe passed the night undisturbed at the campsite, though it had been hard for the former to get to sleep. His thoughts were awhirl with concerns about likely having been stranded out in another dimension or time, and he only slept finally when he became exhausted.</p>

<p>They set off again the following morning and reached the settlement by mid-day.</p>

<p>Archer had told himself not to expect anything any more. Certainly his encounters with the island wildlife had taught him that. Still, he found himself surprised just how behind the town was. It was a ramshackle place, with lumber strewn in areas and houses built out of thatched roofing and sheet-metal, and a timidity among the residents easily perceived in the atmosphere. The roads were dirt paths traversed by both animals and humans alike, and there seemed to be no electric lighting; everything was lit with hurricane lamps and gas-lit street lamps, and with even these being sporadic Archer imagined nighttime here would get very dark indeed. It wasn't enough he'd always been partial to large and modern cities; now he'd been fated to a place so backwards it didn't have proper <i>anything</i>.</p>

<p>He did spy a few other townspeople carrying antiquated Poké Balls like Zoe's. Back home practically everyone would have a pet; here it only looked like a handful of tough trainers did.</p>

<p>The more Archer saw, the more unhappy he began to feel. He'd held onto a sliver of hope that maybe, just maybe, there would have been a telephone or communications system somewhere here where he could get word to Giovanni and sort out the whole situation. The lack thereof was a sobering validation to his mind that he'd been flung dimensions away from the time and space where Team Rocket headquarters were. Was he in a future time, or in the past? At this point he wondered if Giovanni had even been born yet.</p>

<p><i>But Zoe said I was speaking an 'ancient' language,</i> Archer recalled, and then he just felt confused again.</p>

<p>"You'll find more people here who still speak the ancient language. That said, it's not predominant," Zoe said, as if he'd spoken his thoughts aloud. With a glance at Archer, she then asked, "How are you planning to get the island ruler to stop demanding tribute?"</p>

<p>It took Archer a moment before he remembered, <i>Oh, right. She thinks I'm here to shoo away this Marcus guy for them. </i>"Well, first I have to locate him." That much was true regardless of what he intended to do. In reality all he wanted was to get ahold of transportation to the mainland, however the longer he could get these Syndicate shmucks to believe he had their interests in mind, so much the better.</p>

<p>"The PIDF aren't pushovers," Zoe told him. "They're the most well-trained fighters on the island. That's why they've been in power for so long."</p>

<p>When they came in view of the town square, he could see an open-air marketplace lay to one side with people haggling over wares as varied as fruit, fine cloth, and Pokémon, and in the center was a clearing where some people were trying to scrape away blackened marks on the concrete as if there had been a great fire. Houndoom, which Archer had let out of its Poké Ball so it could pad alongside him, was sniffing the air with interest as if it could still smell the remnants of smoke there. Zoe made a beeline for the flea market, and Archer inquired of one of the people trying to clear the cinders:</p>

<p>"Why are there scorch marks on the ground?"</p>

<p>"The Colonel fired the entire commission this morning."</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain the scorch marks on the ground."</p>

<p>He didn't get any reply to this except a suppressed smile and their eyes to avert, as if they thought he was making a joke yet didn't want to be accused of having found it amusing. Houndoom cocked its head to one side, displaying the same dubiousness its trainer felt.</p>

<p>Leaving the people to their work, Archer wandered over to where Zoe was and saw she had purchased some jerky meat, as well as a bag of flour. "Coming into town is the only way to get flour for baking bread without having to harvest the wheat yourself," she explained.</p>

<p>He was less interested in the hassles of day-to-day island life and more on the Pokémon being offered for sale. There were many species he'd seen on the way here, as well as a few other kinds he was familiar with, and even strange ones he'd never seen before. He was debating asking the purchase price and attacks of a particularly powerful-looking stag – the violet deer honestly reminded him of a Legendary Pokémon, yet they were seemingly offering it here like a common breed – when someone called out from behind him and Archer looked up to see another person walking over.</p>

<p>The newcomer was evidently a trainer, judging from the glistening blue capsule hanging from his belt. The man pointed at Houndoom and said something in the island language; when Archer gave Zoe a hopeful glance, she responded for him, and the man accordingly translated what he'd been saying:</p>

<p>"So you're a Pal tamer too, huh? That's kind of a unique Pal you've got there."</p>

<p>"This is my Houndoom," replied Archer.</p>

<p>"I take it you're a rookie then."</p>

<p>"...and what, perchance, makes you say that?"</p>

<p>The man was smug. "Your Pal is puny."</p>

<p>Archer frowned. "My Houndoom is strong enough to beat the best trained animals. We won plenty of battles back on the mainland."</p>

<p>For reasons he could not yet comprehend, Zoe looked awed by his statement. Even the man looked impressed.</p>

<p>"It still couldn't take on the Dancer of the Plains," he asserted.</p>

<p>"...It's a big weasel," Zoe explained to Archer. "It's cute from a distance but it's extremely agile and dangerous. You can recognize it when you see one because you can't tell where its body ends and its tail begins."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a Furret," Archer considered.</p>

<p>"We call it a Chillet," Zoe said.</p>

<p>"Furret aren't dangerous," dismissed Archer. "In fact they're commonplace where I come from."</p>

<p>"I caught the Chillet that made its nest across the bridge. I can guarantee your Pal wouldn't stand a chance against it," the other trainer insisted.</p>

<p>"As much as I'd like to dispute the point with you, I'll only be in town for a while and would rather not waste time comparing the strength of a Houndoom to a common Furret."</p>

<p>Archer and Zoe had started to walk away. But the other trainer, not willing to let it go, shouted after them:</p>

<p>"I challenge you to a battle!"</p>

<p>The words made Archer turn with interest. It had been among the last things he'd imagine to hear in this place. However the idea the island people had Pokémon battles at all provided a coveted sign of normalcy. It had been a while since he'd had a chance to battle for sheer fun of the sport and not in a business-related context.</p>

<p>However, after all he'd observed till now, part of him believed there had to be a catch. "You do mean a match between two trainers, each commanding a Pokémon in a fight?" he said.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I mean," declared the man, "according to the island customs."</p>

<p>Zoe, inexplicably, was tugging at his sleeve. "Come on, let's go Archer."</p>

<p>The man grinned. "Unless you and your scrawny mutt have the souls of Cattiva."</p>

<p>Archer narrowed his eyes and whispered to Zoe. "What the hell is a Cattiva? It sounds like he's trying to insult us."</p>

<p>She reluctantly explained, "You called it a Clefable when you saw a wild one earlier. On this island they're known for cowardice."</p>

<p>"I accept," Archer snarled at him.</p>

<p>Yet as they strolled to the clearing in the center of town, which was now cleared of the charred blaze-marks, Zoe was still visibly concerned. "Archer, are you sure you've been victorious in many battles?"</p>

<p>"Plenty." A throng of interested people were now forming a wide ring around the intended battlefield to see the fight. It was common practice on the mainland too, but with such a rudimentary civilization here he imagined that watching and betting on Pokémon battles were one of the few entertainments the islanders had. "I really don't see why you're so worried. We'll just have our battle and once we see who's raised the stronger Pokémon we'll both go on our way."</p>

<p>"According to the island customs, a Pal battle is a fight to the death."</p>

<p>Archer spun around right at the same instant the man hurled a Poké Ball to the ground, unleashing his prized Chillet.</p>

<p>The blue ferret stood upright.</p>

<p>It was huge. It towered over Archer, easily ten feet high and <i>growling</i>.</p>

<p>"Fuck," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Get out of there!" cried Zoe.</p>

<p>Chillet pulled back at the same time Archer rolled out of the way, and it fired an ice beam right where he'd been. A cloud of condensation filled the air as the ice froze over the grass spreading outward in a jagged star-shape and the Chillet whirled after him in a snarling vengeance.</p>

<p>Before it could strike again, it yelped and sprang back, twisting on the grass to evade as Houndoom shot a stream of fire at it.</p>

<p>The creature now directed its attention to Houndoom, firing its ice attack at the dog in retaliation. Archer scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>"Keep it up, Houndoom!" he called. "Inferno!"</p>

<p>Once again, he had to fall back on Team Rocket's militia training. He directed the fight, using Houndoom's attacks to keep Chillet at bay, while keeping watch on the opposing trainer's actions across the way waiting for when he'd make a move. When he pulled out a hidden dagger, Archer was expecting it.</p>

<p>He threw himself to the side as his opponent lunged at him; the two men fought like animals, struggling and punching on the ground. It ended with Archer holding the dagger to the man's throat.</p>

<p>"You're lucky..." said Archer, breathless, "that I see Pokémon battles as a sport. Consider this a favor, because the next time I'll take tanning your hide as the sport."</p>

<p>Without a second remark he tossed the dagger aside onto the ground and got up, yet he'd only gotten a few paces before Zoe shrieked:</p>

<p>"Archer look out!"</p>

<p>He ducked aside right as his opponent, not to be outdone, hurled the dagger at him; Archer quickly snatched the blade from where it embedded in a wood pillar and instantly flung it back. It struck the other man in the chest, and he collapsed dead.</p>

<p>Archer scowled as he turned and walked over to where he'd been heading before having been so uncouthly interrupted. Houndoom had Chillet pinned down with its forepaws.</p>

<p>The Chillet gazed at him with fear. Archer gestured towards the hills.</p>

<p>"Go," he told it.</p>

<p>Houndoom released Chillet, which backed away before turning and running off as fast as it could.</p>

<p>Zoe came over to where Archer was. "You're letting it go?"</p>

<p>"I don't need an overgrown Furret," he answered. "In any case it was only following its trainer's orders."</p>

<p><i>At least they're partial to Team Rocket's ways: eliminate the trainer, steal the Pokémon. Half of these islanders could be useful minions if their civilization could be modernized,</i> Archer thought as he and Zoe strolled away. Callously indifferent to the deadly duel they'd witnessed, all of the spectators were also returning to their errands as if the battle had merely been a public show. <i>It's pretty lawless around here.</i></p>

<p>They didn't get very far before being faced with four burly soldiers. They wore helmeted armor with uniforms bearing a starred shield-like insignia, belts holding at least three or four Poké Balls each, and carried machine guns.</p>

<p>"You." One of the soldiers gestured brusquely to Archer and then down the path. "You're under arrest."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me I <i>am</i> in trouble for that fucking fight back there," Archer presumed. "That was self defence if nothing more."</p>

<p>"No one cares about the battle," dismissed the soldier. "You're a new Pal tamer here?"</p>

<p>Without giving him a chance to ask or dispute further, they all aimed their weapons point-blank at him. He lifted his hands in a disarming way; Zoe stepped back with worry across her face.</p>

<p>"You're coming with us," reiterated the soldier, and his tone was so stern and emphatic that Archer figured he'd better.</p><h2>Chapter 5 - Marcus and Faleris ✅</h2>

<p>Archer was escorted to a building on a marble platform overlooking the village square, the most well-kept of all the town's structures. Whereas the townspeople dwelt in huts pieced together by whatever they could find, this was a two-story residence with a concrete façade and the interior of fine wood. Relatively modest if one used the mainland as a reference, when compared to its dilapidated surroundings it was downright elegant. It reminded Archer somewhat of the houses in Lentimas Town of the Unova region, known for their squarish architecture.</p>

<p>Upon entering the building through the double-doors, he was immediately met with a wide office, with an ornate tapestry rug spread across a hardwood floor, and a formal desk as large as the one in Giovanni's own office at Team Rocket headquarters. Directly behind the desk, the wall bore the same insignia emblazoned on the soldiers' uniforms – the jagged shield with the star in the center – and seated here was a man who Archer immediately deduced, upon seeing the soldiers halt at attention and salute, was their commander.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers said something to him in the island language; the colonel retorted with irritation, whereupon the soldiers saluted again and left. He then turned towards Archer, and in perfect command of the mainland tongue, said:</p>

<p>"You must forgive my soldiers, they have a tendency to be suspicious of all newcomers to the town. Especially those who show themselves to be experienced Pal tamers." He extended a hand to Archer, who shook it. "Colonel Marcus Dryden," the commander introduced himself. "I am the head of the PIDF."</p>

<p>"Archer Verdi," reciprocated Archer.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard the surname Verdi around this area. What part of the island do you hail from?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Colonel, I'm not even from this island," said Archer. "I'm from the Kanto region."</p>

<p>Marcus regarded him with an inscrutable expression, and Archer added, "I'm trying to find passage back to the mainland. Do you have any boat or aircraft I could charter or buy from you?"</p>

<p>"We have transports, but I'm afraid they're only for PIDF usage and not for charter or sale." Appearing pensive, Marcus then added, "How did you happen to arrive on Palpagos Island?"</p>

<p>"Wild Pals teleported me here." At least he was accustoming himself to the nomenclature, although it still sounded odd to his ear when he said it.</p>

<p>"What about the girl you came to town with?"</p>

<p>"Zoe?"</p>

<p>"I presume you know," Marcus emphasized, "that she's part of a criminal organization on this island."</p>

<p><i>So am I, elsewhere, but let's see where this goes,</i> Archer thought. "I didn't know anything about that," he replied, each word measured.</p>

<p>He still seemed to evaluate him, but arbitrarily then Marcus gave a small shrug as if he'd decided something and his demeanor remained genial. "If you are new here, might I present my Pal Faleris."</p>

<p>It perched on a gold stand on the side of the office, preening itself with nonchalance. Archer admired the creature. "You must raise it well. I've never seen one with such glossy plumage."</p>

<p>"I must thank you for the compliment, Mr. Verdi. I credit its diet," replied Marcus smoothly.</p>

<p>"Regarding that..." Archer ventured, getting curious, "Zoe claims her group is hunting to feed your Faleris, and if they don't provide enough of a tribute every month or so their village will be destroyed."</p>

<p>Marcus scowled. "I don't know what you've been told by her, but the Rayne Syndicate are a notorious band of poachers. Those brigands have been a thorn in the side of all decent people on this island, slaughtering wild Pals wantonly and stealing livestock from the townspeople. The sooner the Syndicate is wiped out, the better."</p>

<p><i>Sounds like the kind of thing they say about Team Rocket, and if Zoe's Syndicate is actually a crude version of our own enterprise then even more reason to be on their side,</i> reasoned Archer, but the discrepancy in Marcus' assertions versus Zoe's begot more questions than answers.</p>

<p>"If that's so," asked Archer, "why haven't your men attacked them already? I'm sure your machine guns are stronger than their hunting rifles."</p>

<p>Archer could see Marcus' brow tighten into a frown, but it was brief. "They excel in evasion. Sometimes they move camp."</p>

<p>He strode to his desk and sat down behind it. "Sit down," he told Archer as he motioned to an armchair in front of the desk. Archer sat and glanced briefly at the paperwork there, all of which was written in elegant penmanship with Unown letters. <i>They apparently use Unown hieroglyphs as their form of writing here on the island,</i> Archer observed.</p>

<p>Marcus did not seem to notice his interest in their writing, and went on, "In any event, I can personally tell you my Faleris eats far more gourmet meals than what the Syndicate ever traps." He didn't elaborate. "So I take it your sole interest, Mr. Verdi, is returning to the Kanto region?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Archer replied.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't help you. As leader of this island, I'd be irresponsible if I allowed such a perilous excursion, knowing there is no territory outside of this island and the vast sea," Marcus continued. "You'd do best to forget such nonsense tales of another land."</p>

<p>"Except I came from there," Archer insisted. "I can tell you firsthand the region exists. I was born and lived my whole life off your island till just about two days ago."</p>

<p>"You've been here two days? Have you told anyone else about this Kanto region?"</p>

<p>Archer hesitated. He was starting to get the uneasy feeling this was the prelude to an interrogation of some kind. Marcus drummed his fingers once on the desk, and when it became evident neither man intended to break the silence, Archer relented and went first.</p>

<p>"Does that matter?"</p>

<p>"A curiosity. Nothing more."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Marcus reached into his desk drawer, and suddenly Archer was face-to-face with a revolver.</p>

<p>"One that determines just how fast you'll die."</p>

<p>Tension made Archer grip the armrest of the chair, and he replied, "I have no intent to stir up anything here. All I want is to get off Palpagos Island and go back to the mainland and you'll never see me again."</p>

<p>Marcus gave a cold half-smile. "If I permit you to return, no doubt you'll tell the entire mainland about this island. And that wouldn't be very helpful to me."</p>

<p>Reacting quickly, Archer struck Marcus' hand. The revolver fell to the floor as he swung back at him; Archer stumbled under the force of the blow but succeeded in yanking Marcus' backward with him, and they both collided against the desk.</p>

<p>The struggle scattered documents from the desktop to the floor. Most were technical papers of some kind bearing a modernistic, semi-circled starburst symbol in one corner, which Archer only vaguely noticed in the chaos of the moment. Among them however was a single photograph that made him halt.</p>

<p>It was a black-and-white photograph, yet it clearly displayed a glass pillar within which dozens of unhappy Unowns were crammed.</p>

<p>They were all vowels.</p>

<p>In that instant, Marcus took advantage of the distraction. He snatched the photograph out of Archer's hands, and just as quickly made a gesture to the air.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Verdi, now I believe you've seen too much."</p>

<p>Before Archer could realize what the signal meant, Faleris swooped down from its perch with a screech, its talons colliding like daggers with his back and slamming him to the ground. Archer wrested aside as it tried to peck at him, and unable to get loose from where he was pinned to the floor he ended up grappling with the huge falcon. Faleris pulled back, smoke and fire building in its throat.</p>

<p>"No, Faleris!" ordered Marcus, envisioning the small office going up in flames. It was enough for Archer to break free, darting out of the way and escaping outside.</p>

<p>Immediately several PIDF soldiers were upon him; with a calculated punch, Archer hit one of the men in the ribs and snatched away a machine gun, whereupon he fired a line of bullets across the ground at their feet.</p>

<p>Marcus lingered at the entrance, staring at the sight with incredulous fury at how this newcomer had more combat training than his soldiers.</p>

<p>Archer smirked as the group of his enemies now hesitated, having been placed on the defensive. "<i>You're</i> supposed to be the island's most well-trained army...?"</p>

<p>A short distance away, Zoe had been waiting for Archer to return and had let both her pets out of their spheres in the meantime to feed them; she saw when this confrontation occurred, and so did her grass monkey, Tanzee.</p>

<p>Zoe couldn't stop the excited monkey before it leapt with a shriek and grabbed the weapon away from Archer. It was so unexpected that he fell to the ground ungracefully as Tanzee whirled about screeching and firing wantonly. Archer ended up scrambling for cover, and ended up crouched on the ground behind a water trough with Zoe and the frightened Pengullet.</p>

<p>"What the fuck is up with your monkey?" he asked, as they ducked down to avoid gunfire.</p>

<p>"Tanzee likes noisy things," Zoe justified.</p>

<p>"We need to get that gun back before it wastes all the ammunition," Archer scowled.</p>

<p>She peeked out from behind their hiding place. "Tanzee, come back," she ordered, and tried to recall it to its sphere. Tanzee hopped aside quickly, avoiding the recall beam yet still hanging on to the machine gun.</p>

<p>Across the way, Marcus recalled Faleris to its capsule and pulled back as bullets showered across the area. Townspeople screamed and ran for cover, and one of his soldiers gave an outcry as he dropped dead in the hail. Marcus bit back a curse as he glared out at the town square, now a miniature war zone due to the trigger-happy monkey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Archer cast out Houndoom's Poké Ball, which opened with a flash of white light, and the dog appeared snarling.</p>

<p>"Houndoom, distract Tanzee!" he called.</p>

<p>Houndoom shot a thin ember at Tanzee to get its attention. The monkey screeched a protest, but the natural competitiveness of Pokémon or Pals or whatever they were called rose to the forefront fast and it tossed its deadly toy aside to engage in a battle with Houndoom. As Tanzee shot a barrage of leaves at its opponent, and Houndoom nimbly bounded around to evade them, both Archer and the PIDF soldiers ran out of hiding at the same time.</p>

<p>It was Archer who reached the discarded weapon first. He took the machine gun, aimed at the soldiers and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>It clicked harmlessly, out of bullets.</p>

<p>"Shit," muttered Archer.</p>

<p>Zoe had now managed to recall Tanzee, as well as Pengullet, and she hurried to Archer's side as he turned, slinging the gun over his shoulder with a strap, and dashed away. "Where are we going?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Away from here!" he shouted back while running.</p>

<p>He then caught a glimpse of a large animal tethered off to the side. When it lifted its majestic head to face them, as if displeased with all the noise, Archer instantly turned and headed directly for it.</p>

<p>"The ice type Rapidash!" Or at least it was the closest thing he could compare the horse to; it had no horn, and ice and frost encrusted around its hooves and mane where a typical Rapidash would have fire.</p>

<p>He didn't notice the wings folded alongside its body.</p>

<p>Archer grabbed Zoe's hand and helped her onto the animal before urging it on with a flick of the reins. With a neigh, the horse whipped around at a signal and galloped off.</p>

<p>When Marcus saw this, he was doubly furious. "Our Frostallion...! After them!" he called.</p>

<p>Archer glanced back; he could see they had sent out wolves, which were such massive creatures the soldiers were astride them as they aimed their rifles and gave chase down the forest road.</p>

<p>"They're riding...Lycanroc? They're riding <i>giant</i> Lycanroc?" Archer's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"The Direhowl?" Zoe questioned.</p>

<p>"Run faster," he urged the horse. Frostallion, the horse, immediately picked up its pace.</p>

<p>They raced around the winding trail, leaping fallen logs and craggy ditches and bracken of all sorts, till suddenly they came to an abrupt halt before two fierce-looking birds – perhaps half the size of Marcus' Faleris, but still impressive creatures in their own right – fluttering up ahead. They appeared to be protecting their aerie in a tall tree beside the path.</p>

<p>"Pidgeot?" Archer guessed.</p>

<p>"Galeclaw," Zoe replied. The look on her face was enough to tell Archer that coming across them wasn't a good thing.</p>

<p>The Galeclaw screeched and with a slash of their wings, a sharp gust spun at Archer and Zoe like a whirlwind. Frostallion reared on its hind legs and Archer swiftly turned it around to run in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Emboldened, the Galeclaw swooped down in pursuit; Frostallion narrowly bolted aside to evade their talons. Archer could see the soldiers gaining on them as well, and without a second thought he pulled the reins in the direction of the underbrush.</p>

<p>They were now being chased by both the detachment of PIDF soldiers and the two territorial Galeclaw, both with the same viciousness in mind.</p>

<p>"Why does everything here want to kill us?!" exclaimed Archer.</p>

<p>"That's just how the world is, isn't it?" inquired Zoe.</p>

<p>Archer clenched his teeth. "Screw this damn island—!" He turned yet again to address the running horse. "Go as fast as you can!"</p>

<p>The horse flattened its ears. Archer nearly lost his balance when it suddenly jumped, extending its wings and swooping into the sky with a delighted whinny.</p>

<p>This did nothing to dissuade the Galeclaw, which dove at them in spinning tackles. Frostallion was faster, and flew around the energy flares the birds let loose in their wake. So preoccupied with parrying these attacks, both Archer and Zoe failed to notice one of the soldiers below aiming his rifle at Frostallion and firing.</p>

<p>Frostallion lurched as the gunshot struck one of its wings, and its riders nearly fell out of the saddle as the Pegasus tumbled to the ground, one wing outstretched and stumbling painfully but quickly regaining its footing and returning to a gallop.</p>

<p>They ran on horseback to a cliff peak overlooking the whole island with the mysterious tower in the distance. Miles below Archer could see a river rushing to a waterfall. <i>There's nowhere to go,</i> he realized.</p>

<p>"We're dead," said Archer.</p>

<p>"No, we're prisoners," Zoe replied.</p>

<p>Archer turned first to her, then spun around to look back at the approaching enemies, who had slung their rifles back over their shoulders and were reaching for the shining blue Pal Spheres.</p>

<p><i>Of course. If the Poké Balls are hand-crafted, there's no safeguard to stop them from catching human beings...</i> Terrible memories of a former captivity raced through his mind again, melding with old feelings of terror till he could almost relive them, and in a split-second decision Archer pulled back on the horse's reins.</p>

<p>"Archer, what are you doing?" asked Zoe, eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Better dead than a slave!" Archer declared, and before she could stop him he gave a cry and urged their mount to jump. Frostallion bolted off the cliff, beating its wings in a futile effort to go airborne; Zoe screamed and hung on for dear life as they hurtled down to crash into the water.</p>

<p>The Direhowl skidded to a halt and even the Galeclaw gave a surprised screech as their prey was lost to the waves.</p>

<p>The current was not as unforgiving as Archer had imagined. They washed up on the opposite shore, soaking wet but very much alive and free.</p>

<p>Archer coughed as he hauled himself onto dry land. Beside him Zoe was helping the horse trot onto the rocks; its injured wing was still outstretched, but Archer could see the wound was just a graze.</p>

<p>He glanced back at the cliff, where the party of PIDF soldiers and their Direhowl were now embroiled in a skirmish with the wild Galeclaw. It seemed they were trying to catch the birds so they could use them to fly down and pursue Archer and Zoe further; the idea evidently did not appeal to the two flying Pokémon.</p>

<p>"We'd better get out of here," said Archer, and leading Frostallion by the reins they retreated quietly into the cover of the forest.</p><hr>

<p>Up on the clifftop, Marcus had arrived riding Faleris. His men gave a salute as he dismounted and strolled to the cliff's edge.</p>

<p>"You say they survived?" he demanded, his eyes searching the woodland.</p>

<p>"Yes Colonel," replied one of the guards.</p>

<p>"Ten-thousand pieces of gold to the man who brings them back, <i>alive</i>," growled Marcus, raising his voice so that all his soldiers could hear. "Faleris likes his meat fresh."</p><h2>Chapter 6 - Jett's Flowers ✅</h2>

<p>Over the next few days, the urban redevelopment project took hold of Lumiose, unveiling Jett's ideas for a modern and thriving city and bringing them into action. They began with a marketing strategy to boost the residents enthusiasm about the project. News broadcasts started announcing the progress of the city's revamping on an almost daily basis; and whenever Jett showed up to see how her workers were laboring, a crowd of onlookers would gather around to gawk at the renovations. Jett saw people's interests were peaking so she started handing out flyers with drawings of what she envisioned the redevelopment would look like. Old buildings got a new coat of paint, broken sidewalks were cemented, and new parks were created with trees being planted abundantly.</p>

<p>Of all these things, the most minor yet the most marvelous were the flowers. She had them planted along the road verges and in the new wild zones to accent the stretches of parkland. The flowers were so exotic, they received compliments by practically everybody who saw them.</p>

<p>She didn't admit where she'd gotten them from; certainly the city council had no need to know of the quiet little island that lay isolated in the middle of the ocean, forgotten by history and all except the few who had some business there. All she said of the flowers' origin was that they were tropical blossoms, and made up some tale of having purchased them in a Hoenn greenhouse where they'd bred a hybrid of bougainvillea and lilies that she'd procured at a discounted price, and everyone concurred that it was one of the best investments of taxpayer finances Quasartico Inc. could have made.</p>

<p>One day, in the midst of Jett overseeing workers plant some of the flowers, Corbeau showed up.</p>

<p>"Well, hello Corbeau," she greeted him.</p>

<p>"Hello Jett," he replied, "I have some news for you. I was able to get the approval for the renovation of Prism Tower. I have no doubt you will repay the favor in time."</p>

<p>"I always have," she concurred.</p>

<p>Corbeau glanced over at the flowerbed. "My, what striking flowers."</p>

<p>"They also have the most delightful perfume..." said Jett with a smile.</p>

<p>"Are they poisonous?"</p>

<p>"What kind of a question is that, are they poisonous?" she said with good-natured humor.</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled slyly. "You know I'm a poison type gym leader. They have a certain look about them; it's hard to explain. Some pots might do well in the gym lobby for show."</p>

<p>Jett could easily imagine him using poisonous flowers for a myriad of other things as well, probably very illegal things, but as she was involved in a series of dubious affairs herself it hardly mattered. "I don't know if they're toxic, however you're welcome to take some if you would like."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," Corbeau said as he picked up a couple of the potted plants. "Talk to you later," he added as he walked off with the plants.</p>

<p><i>Actually, keeping one of these for my desk might not be such a bad idea,</i> Jett considered, and decided to take a flower pot back to her office as well. She'd been looking for a suitable workplace plant for a while, and these rare flowers seemed like a perfect accent for the desk.</p>

<p>A day later, Jett went to see if the flowers were taking root and adapting well to their new environment, but what she found was an exasperated gardener shaking his head as he looked at the plants.</p>

<p>"Mr. Seymore, what is the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Silph...the flowers are not in the place where we left them! They moved."</p>

<p>Jett scowled. "They couldn't have moved themselves. They're plants."</p>

<p>"Ma'am... I've been doing this type of job for 40 years... The plants are not where we placed them yesterday."</p>

<p>Jett looked around the area where the workers had been planting the flowers, the gardener followed her pointing out the various places where the ground had been moved around during the process. Sure enough, Jett was convinced that the flowering plants were not in their original spots.</p>

<p>The gardener's own Pokémon, Bellsprout and Oddish, were watching the conversation, and now glanced at each other without saying anything. Jett noticed and gave them an askance look. "They're <i>plants</i>," she reiterated, "not plant <i>Pokémon</i>. ...I wonder if your Pokémon saw anything."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Seymore, "but they're staying quiet about it."</p>

<p>"Well, they're not totally gone, considering they moved...or were moved...only a few feet, it should be okay. Anything else I should know about them?"</p>

<p>"The fertilizer seems to make them wilt," added Seymore, "It appears that they fare better when allowed to grow wild without aid from man."</p>

<p>"Alright. Keep me informed." Jett turned and left.</p><hr>

<p>The Pokémon Research Lab was a prestigious institute on Lumiose's South Boulevard, a three story converted estate that was almost as iconic a location as Prism Tower.</p>

<p>Jett really didn't expect to be contacted by the institute's top scientists – the acting director Professor Mabel, and the director emeritus Professor Sycamore – since it wasn't as if she had any business with them, but when she heard from the two anyway she was pleasantly surprised by what they had to say.</p>

<p>"Ever since the urban redevelopment project began, we've seen an unusual uptick in the amount of wild Pokémon coming into the city," Mabel told her. "It's almost like they're drawn to something."</p>

<p>"Evidently," said Jett, "they like the new parks and grassy spaces. This is wonderful to hear!"</p>

<p>She certainly thought that way, at least till Quasartico's top construction foreman walked into her office looking in total disarray.</p>

<p>"Johnston what the hell happened to you?" exclaimed Jett.</p>

<p>"I'm turning in my resignation," he announced.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We got attacked by a wild Pidgeot. The whole construction site we had near Jaune Plaza is destroyed."</p>

<p>She was so surprised at this, it left her momentarily speechless. He went on relating what had happened:</p>

<p>"We were at our work when suddenly we all look up and see this giant bird flying straight towards us, shrieking like it wanted to declare war. It knocked out all the Drilbur and Machoke we had working on the site and then turned its wrath on the crane. The entire thing came crashing down on our bulldozers..."</p>

<p>"A <i>Pidgeot</i>," she echoed incredulously.</p>

<p>"But this was one hell of a Pidgeot. It had a longer crest than usual and feathers tipped with blue."</p>

<p>Jett couldn't care less what it looked like; the fact that it was a rampaging Pidgeot at such a high level was enough for her. "Where did it go?"</p>

<p>"No one knows; it just sort of flew off. Once it finished demolishing the entire construction site, of course."</p>

<p>"This is unbelievable," Jett griped, "Incidents like this could turn people against the redevelopment project. It will cause us bad publicity if someone decides that it's dangerous to let high-level wild Pokémon nest within Lumiose."</p>

<p>She wouldn't have initially thought it to be a problem; after all, more wild Pokémon for trainers to catch meant more revenue, and many things could be overlooked for revenue, were it not for the fact that she knew there was a limit to what even the most practical-minded government officials were willing to tolerate.</p>

<p>Jett recalled that off in Kanto, in Cerulean City, the region made an effort to cordon off an outlying cavern where high-level Pokémon could naturally be found. It was considered so dangerous for the average traveller that only trainers who owned extremely strong Pokémon themselves were permitted in. Bribery and blackmail could only do so much if the council thought they could get more votes from appearing to take a stand for public safety.</p>

<p>"You didn't do anything that might've angered this Pidgeot?" Jett pursued. "You didn't destroy its nest or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"We know better than to harm Pokémon eggs," Johnston protested, "As far as we can tell, the attack came out of nowhere. At least five of our people quit on the spot, saying they feared for their lives. It's one thing to see a Hyper Beam from the safety of your seat in a stadium. It's another thing altogether to see that Hyper Beam aimed towards <i>you</i>, and from a wild animal besides."</p>

<p>"Look, Johnston...I understand, really, but you've got to understand my position too," said Jett. "Would you stay on for an increase in salary? This was clearly some sort of a fluke; since when have you known a wild Pokémon to go rogue like that?"</p>

<p>"Well..."</p>

<p>"More practically, it will look strange to people if they see so many on Quasartico's construction crews resigning out of nowhere. I don't want this getting out."</p>

<p>Jett succeeded in convincing the man not to quit, and as soon as he left the office she scowled to herself.</p>

<p>
  <i>Why couldn't this rogue Pokémon go somewhere else? Or better yet, if it had to go on a rampage in Lumiose City...at least raze the south-eastern side that I can't get the demolition permits for.</i>
</p><h2>Chapter 7 - Team Rocket's Search ✅</h2>

<p>During all this time, Giovanni had been trying to find out what had happened to his godson Archer.</p>

<p>When he was told about the Unowns and how they had seemingly teleported Archer away somewhere, Giovanni's first reaction had been an indifferent shrug and orders to keep an eye on the telephones for when his godson invariably called from wherever he was, so that they could send a helicopter to pick him up. Wild Unowns were notorious mischief-makers and he imagined Archer had been sent to one of the adjoining regions, or perhaps deposited in one of the nearby forest routes where he'd have to walk home. It was when afternoon of the next day arrived and there had still been no communication from him that Giovanni started to think something amiss. He called James, Jessie, and Meowth to his office, located on the basement level of the casino he owned in Celadon City.</p>

<p>"I need you to find the Unowns that appeared at the party yesterday and ask them where they sent Archer." As Giovanni spoke, he stroked Persian; the large cream-furred cat lounged on his lap, purring. "We currently know of two locations where wild Unown live: the Ruins of Alph outside of Violet City, and the Tanoby Ruins in the Sevii Island archipelago...Be careful you don't get spirited away yourselves."</p>

<p>"On it, boss," purred Meowth, and with that the trio headed off on their mission.</p><hr>

<p>The first place the trio headed was to Violet City in the Johto region. Johto neighbored Kanto and was but a train trip away; the Ruins of Alph, in turn, was easily accessible from Violet City on foot.</p>

<p>Once the site of an ancient civilization, today the majestic temples and dwellings had become something of a tourist trap. Visitors snapped photographs and milled about gawking at crumbling limestone architecture and reading small plaques that had been set up around every possible landmark and statue, detailing the area's historic significance. To one side was a trailer where archeologists worked out of, trying to piece together the ruins' remaining mysteries; to the other, in a similar trailer under the canopy of a cherry blossom tree, was a gift shop.</p>

<p>While the majority of people visiting the site were tourists, there were also trainers, most of whom were on their badge-collecting journeys, having made a pit-stop here to try their luck catching some of the wild Natu or Smeargle only found in the tall grass behind the temple ruins. They could be seen intermittently, searching through the reeds, sometimes accompanied by a Pokémon either perched on their shoulders or following at their heels.</p>

<p>And then very rarely there were people like the Team Rocket trio.</p>

<p>"You know it woulda been easier if you guys were in civilian clothes instead of your uniforms," Meowth criticized, as James and Jessie peered down from a rocky ledge with their binoculars. "We could've gone down there and mingle with the tour guide group and be welcomed in through the front entrance. Just a couple of tourists and their Meowth."</p>

<p>"Oh come on Meowth, where's your sense of adventure?" replied Jessie, her blue eyes glittering.</p>

<p>"Back at headquarters, where you two's left your brains," hissed Meowth.</p>

<p>"The Unown live in the cordoned-off section of the ruins," James pointed out, "the same part they don't let tourists explore. For all we know they don't even have a way to access it through the main entrance."</p>

<p>"...so if we're sneaking in," added Jessie, "we may as well do it in full Team Rocket flair."</p>

<p>The uniforms worn by all Team Rocket admins were white and bore a bright red letter R, as well as gloves and boots of black patent leather. On their belts they carried their organization's signature armaments of coiled whips and Poké Balls, both of which they could wield with deadly surety if it came to it. It was undeniably flashy attire, however Team Rocket was notorious for spectacle; that much was true.</p>

<p>Meowth still saw little justification for it now. "All these old temples have secret passageways and tunnels that lead everywhere," meowed the cat, "You just gotta poke at the stones in the wall and see which one opens up."</p>

<p>"Okay, the tourists went inside the gift shop. They're distracted...now's our chance," grinned Jessie, lowering her binoculars. With a quick motion to her companions they all leapt down from the ledge and darted across to the buildings on the far side of the site.</p>

<p>These structures looked no less impressive than those the tourists were being shown, but they were surrounded by overgrown grass. They were separated from the rest of the site by a glistening, winding creek, which nature fed via a freshwater spring from nearby Union Cave. A wood sign posted beside the creek read:</p>

<p align="center">DANGER – WILD UNOWN<br />
MANAGEMENT WILL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENCES</p>

<p>"What is that supposed to mean?" asked Meowth skeptically, tipping his head to one side.</p>

<p>Seeing James and Jessie trudge ahead uninterested, he sprang to his paws and chased after them without a second thought. "...hey, guys! Wait for <i>Me-owth</i>!"</p>

<p>It was a simple matter for the trio to get into one of the crumbling temple ruins. They followed a main passageway straight down until they reached a large chamber enclosed by smooth walls inscribed with Unown hieroglyphics. A gash on the ceiling, from which flowering vines were trying to creep, allowed sunlight to filter in and illuminate the otherwise windowless interior.</p>

<p>The trio stepped into the sunlit area and stood in silence for awhile.</p>

<p>"What now?" asked James.</p>

<p>"Maybe if we just hang around a bit..." Jessie replied, "Unowns might sense us and show up."</p>

<p>"That's a big <i>if</i>," Meowth said, not at all convinced.</p>

<p>They waited for about five minutes nonetheless and suddenly a large glittering ball of light appeared before them, it looked like a bubble with something inside. They were Unowns. As they came clearer into view, the bubble light dissipated and the Unowns began squeaking with excitement.</p>

<p>Meowth began translating. "Guys, they recognize the uniforms. They're desperately trying to inform us about something but they're all talking at once!"</p>

<p>"Tell them to take turns talking," Jessie said.</p>

<p>"Yeah Meowth," added James, "We've got time, as long as we get the information that Giovanni wants, and needs."</p>

<p>Meowth spoke to the Unowns and they immediately lined up to take turns speaking, as the cat translated.</p>

<p>"This is their main residence," he began, "The Tanoby Ruins is one of their island retreats."</p>

<p>"One of?" asked James.</p>

<p>"That's where the trouble started," Meowth continued translating, "they were visiting one of their other seasonal escapes and discovered people had taken over the inside of their high-rise."</p>

<p>"It's not unheard of for archeologists and explorers to start charting forgotten ruins and monuments of the sort you letters hang out in," stated Jessie. "Half of the Ruins of Alph are used as a tourist attraction."</p>

<p>"Except the humans <i>here</i> coexist with the Unown," replied Meowth, as the Unown began squeaking a response. "They leave a portion of the site undisturbed to be a habitat for the wild Pokémon. But apparently these humans didn't want to share." Twitching his tail, the cat added, "The Unown say the vowels were all kidnapped by a foul-tempered man with a giant bird."</p>

<p>"You mean 'caught'," specified James.</p>

<p>"They mean kidnapped," Meowth emphasized, with a growl, "after they tried to communicate with the intruders. They say not only was their group ambushed and trapped in an unfair fight by this guy, but they haven't been able to sense where their friends are being held. So they went to get help."</p>

<p>James and Jessie exchanged a glance. When it became clear neither knew quite what to say, Jessie turned back towards Meowth. "Ask them where they sent Archer."</p>

<p>Meowth looked over at the Unown, which squeaked. The cat flattened his ears.</p>

<p>"Well Meowth?" prodded James.</p>

<p>"What did they say?" added Jessie.</p>

<p>Meowth sighed. "You're not gonna like this, guys..."</p><hr>

<p>"Palpagos Island?" Giovanni echoed.</p>

<p>The three Team Rocket agents had gone back to headquarters straightaway after having spoken to the Unown. They met with their boss in his office, where he was seated at his desk with his pet Persian ever-present beside him.</p>

<p>Giovanni listened with inexpressive silence as the trio recounted everything they'd been told, but when they told him the name of where Archer had supposedly been teleported, there was no masking his confusion.</p>

<p>"Do you know the place, boss?" Meowth asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"I've never even heard of it," Giovanni replied, frowning.</p>

<p>"The Unown say it's somewhere in the middle of the ocean, in an area <i>they</i> call the Sea of Wonders, far from most colonized regions," explained Jessie. "But they wouldn't give us specifics."</p>

<p>"They don't seem to understand the concept of map coordinates, unfortunately," James added. "They offered to warp us there, though."</p>

<p>"Which we immediately declined, saying we needed to speak to you first," Jessie finished.</p>

<p>"But why the hell did they take Archer?" asked Giovanni.</p>

<p>"They like him."</p>

<p>Right as Giovanni was shaking his head and about to answer this, there was a flash of light and a small cluster of Unown teleported into the office.</p>

<p>"If it isn't our bevy of clever consonants," Giovanni proclaimed, though he took pains not to annoy them too much. Not even the don of the Team Rocket empire wished to make an enemy of Unowns; the fact someone out there had evidently already done so, and flagrantly, only spoke to that person's lack of intelligence in Giovanni's considered view.</p>

<p>The Unowns began squeaking in unison. Meowth translated, "The Unown all want to apologize because they say in retrospect they weren't very clear on where the island was."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that," Giovanni said, clasping his hands expectantly on the desk in front of him.</p>

<p>"They say it's really easy to find," continued Meowth, as one of the Unown began chirping adamantly. "It's the same place where Temporal Tower stands."</p>

<p>"...and what is Temporal Tower?"</p>

<p>"A big tower they say has stood the test of time."</p>

<p>Giovanni just stared at the Unowns, his expression wholly unreadable. It was his Persian who gave an opinionated meow. The Unown that had been chirping before answered the large cat's comment with a series of squeaks.</p>

<p>"Can't they simply teleport Archer back?" Giovanni spoke again.</p>

<p>Meowth glanced at the Unown, which gave another squeak. "They can't do that," the cat translated.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They say he's not where they left him. Maybe someone took him." Meowth turned back to the Unown with a hiss. "...what do ya mean, 'someone took him'? That's the lamest excuse I ever..."</p>

<p>"Meowth..." mollified Jessie, patting the cat on the head in a dissuading way when one of the Unown retorted with an angry chirp. "Maybe we shouldn't be so hasty to accuse these cute little Unown."</p>

<p>"Especially when we haven't made our hotel reservations or bought return-flight tickets yet," James emphasized.</p>

<p>"<i>Ffftt</i>," Meowth replied noncommittally, his ears now lying flat and tail lashing.</p>

<p>Giovanni, meanwhile, rose from his desk and stepped over to a bookshelf on the side of the office, where he retrieved an atlas from the tomes placed there. It was hardbound in brown leather and looked antiquated.</p>

<p>"Many regions were renamed when their leaderships decided to merge into world government," said Giovanni, walking back to his desk. "The Sinnoh region, for instance, used to be called Hisui. It's possible the island the Unown are referring to is known to us in modern time by another name."</p>

<p>He opened the book and began sifting through the maps, the Unown crowding around to look over his shoulder.</p>

<p>After a while, Giovanni spoke. "I've found it on the map...in the southern hemisphere. It has been largely abandoned by our government for many years; I recall them saying it simply dropped off radar many years back. I also recall something else interesting...there is a law that states the regional council can sell land that is languishing from development."</p>

<p>Jessie and James looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of a new development, boss?" asked James.</p>

<p>"Might be," Giovanni said as he placed the book back on the shelf. "Another interesting thing is that the regional councilman in Kanto is none other than a man who has an uncollected debt with Rocket Enterprises." He sat down at his desk and picked up the phone.</p>

<p>"Time to collect," he said.</p><hr>

<p>Mr. Lear had a not-so-flattering reputation as a chronic partygoer and perpetual snob, but with a fine lineage dating back to the era of Kanto royalty and his abundant social connections, he could afford the risk of squandering his good name for a hedonistic lifestyle – even considering he <i>was</i> the eminent regional councilman for Kanto.</p>

<p>So when Giovanni telephoned him at his office, Lear's usually standoffish manner towards most people was immediately cast aside and he rushed to be as complaisant as he was expected to be towards the don. Team Rocket had maneuvered the election behind-the-scenes to his favor, after all. He owed them.</p>

<p>Giovanni told him he wanted to converse in person so within a half hour, the head of Team Rocket was sitting across a desk speaking with the regional councilman for Kanto.</p>

<p>"How may I be of service, Mr. Delavita?"</p>

<p>"Simple, Mr. Lear." Giovanni began, "We have come to collect the debt you have with us."</p>

<p>Lear felt his throat go dry and sat forward in his chair with his hands clasped together. He cleared his voice and spoke up. "What is your request...sir?"</p>

<p>"It shouldn't be much of a problem for you Lear," the Team Rocket don answered, "As I understand it, you have the authority to sell off regional land that remains undeveloped by our government."</p>

<p>"Well, yes. Yes indeed," Lear sighed and sat back in his chair as he began feeling a bit more at ease.</p>

<p>Giovanni looked him straight in the eyes and replied:</p>

<p>"I want to buy an island."</p><h2>Chapter 8 - Bamboo Groves ✅</h2>

<p>"Just over this hill," Zoe was saying, as she and Archer traipsed through the forest. "My family had a cabin in these parts. No one's lived in it for years, but we'll be able to hide from the searchers till the furor blows over."</p>

<p>The Hoenn region back home was infamous for its long and grueling ocean routes, a bane for trainers who were voyaging without a flying type. Archer decided that if Hoenn had too much water, Palpagos Island had too many cliffs. They had climbed at least five different cliffs, and then an equal amount back down to get to their present location. He was exhausted.</p>

<p>They were on foot again. With Frostallion injured, Archer used the last empty Poké Ball he had with him to capture it so they could carry it instead of the other way round and the creature could rest. He was lucky the islanders' Pal Spheres did not register captures in the same way as mainland Poké Balls, or else he would not have been able to 'recapture' Frostallion so easily.</p>

<p>Weariness with the terrain was yet one more reason Archer felt eager to get back to Team Rocket as soon as he possibly could. Presuming the Unowns were being held somewhere on the island, Archer simply had to find them and free them so they could teleport him back to Giovanni's mansion and he could laugh this whole nightmare off like a fever dream. He only wished it <i>was</i> a dream. Their near-capture and narrow escape from the PIDF army still unnerved Archer, who didn't want to imagine being taken prisoner, let alone captured in a Poké Ball.</p>

<p>He'd already had that experience once, back home on the mainland, at the hands of an enemy of Team Rocket.</p>

<p>The mere idea of it happening again sent shivers though him even now, especially in this no-mans-land where hope of rescue would be slim. Of course the idea of capturing humans in Poké Balls like one did wild Pokémon was uncommon, at least on the mainland; not only was it explicitly outlawed there as a human rights violation, it was prevented by safeguards on all factory-manufactured Poké Balls, so Archer realized he might have been letting his imagination get the better of him back at the cliff.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he mentioned the possibility to Zoe. Circumspectly, of course, since he didn't exactly want to tell her anything about his life story, but he did want to feel out the likelihood of what might happen here so he knew what to possibly prepare himself for.</p>

<p>"Throw Pal Spheres at us? I don't know about that. We'd certainly have been surrounded and marched back to town," Zoe replied, and then added, "You know catching humans with Pal Spheres is considered inhumane on our island. It's seen as the most humiliating way to be taken prisoner... Then again I wouldn't put it past the PIDF; they're as apt to accuse others for things that they freely do themselves if they claim it's to further the community interest."</p>

<p>"No one risks calling out the double-standards, I guess."</p>

<p>"Dissidents are all either publicly executed or disappear."</p>

<p><i>Disappearing</i> was exactly what worried him. Uncertainty of fate was worse than certain death.</p>

<p>"When we get to the cabin," Archer commented, hoping to distract himself, "we're going to have to find medicine to heal this horse...you called it a Frostallion?" He realized he hadn't seen anything at the town that looked like a Pokémon Center. "Do you have any kind of a veterinary clinic around here?"</p>

<p>She didn't quite know what he meant, so he explained further, "Somewhere that heals injured animals?"</p>

<p>Zoe shook her head. "If your Pal is hurt, you can find berries and healing herbs in the forest, but other than that you're on your own."</p>

<p>He supposed in that case they let their Pokémon heal whatever mild bruises they got by themselves, like wild ones did when they fought. <i>That's greatly inefficient,</i> Archer thought with disapproval.</p>

<p>"I'm just surprised we <i>have</i> a Frostallion," Zoe said.</p>

<p>"It wasn't that hard to steal."</p>

<p>"No... what I mean is, they're extremely rare Pals. They're what we call a Legendary Pal; they're extremely powerful, and so rare they're practically endangered."</p>

<p>"We call our endangered species Legendary Pokémon too," remarked Archer appreciatively. "It seems that for every difference this island has to where I come from, there's a similarity too."</p>

<p>It was the kind of thing that had been an enigma for Archer till now. But if the Unown were here, and Marcus knew of the mainland regions, then Archer had assurances he hadn't been tossed through some time portal or into a parallel dimension. He was on the same planet and time, he just wasn't familiar with this tropical region. He couldn't understand how an entire island could be hidden from the rest of the world however, and he still couldn't figure out the unfamiliar sky with its strange stars and upside-down moon either.</p>

<p>Archer tried to make memory of anything he might've read at one point or other in a school textbook about why the latter would be. Maybe it was some kind of astronomical mirage...?</p>

<p>Zoe seemed to have something else on her mind though, which she at last voiced straightforwardly. "Now that you see how strong Marcus and his Pal are, are you still going to fight him off for us?"</p>

<p>"We made a business deal, and a deal is a deal," Archer assured her. "I'm not going to go back on my word. Where I come from, I worked as a businessman...of sorts. Our business deals were matters of life and death."</p>

<p>"So you were an assassin."</p>

<p>Damn, she read him so easily. He half-wondered what had given away that his remark was less figurative and more drastically literal. Something in his tone maybe, or the furtive half-smile he'd futilely tried to suppress, or perhaps she was naturally perceptive? "...I was a businessman," he said tersely.</p>

<p>"The way you fought at the town was more like a warrior," Zoe observed, "What was the name of the place you worked?"</p>

<p>"Rocket Enterprises," he replied, "but to our enemies we are known as Team Rocket."</p>

<p>"I thought so," Zoe shrugged, "It sounds sort of like our group...it's okay...it's a way of life."</p>

<p>Archer decided he wasn't going to discuss the intricacies of Team Rocket training or missions with her quite yet.</p>

<p>"I've got my own reasons for going after Marcus," Archer redirected the conversation. "He has those Unowns, and I need the Unowns to teleport me home. And even if I can't find the Unowns for whatever reason, I know his army has transportation at his disposal, because he admitted so; I just have to get ahold of one or the other."</p>

<p>They soon came to a short cliff overlooking an idyllic covert. A spring of fresh water rippled from the rock face into a small pond, around which grew a thicket of tall bamboo amidst mossy grass, and to one side was a small wood cabin with overgrown ivy cascades.</p>

<p>"This part of the island is known as Bamboo Groves," explained Zoe. "That said, only certain secluded areas in these woods have bamboo...this is one of them."</p>

<p>It reminded Archer of Verdanturf Town in the Hoenn region; the grass was as green and the air as fresh and easy to breathe. They walked over to the cabin and went inside.</p>

<p>For somewhere that had not been dwelt in for some time, the interior was surprisingly well-kept and cozy, with windows overlooking the pond, and plush furnishings in excellent condition. To the side was a fireplace, evidently more for cooking than for having to keep warm on a tropical island. There was only one bed in the cabin, but there was a loft too, which was accessed by a small ladder and stocked with extra blankets and pillows, and which Archer immediately offered to take so as to leave Zoe the bed.</p>

<p>If he had to hide out somewhere, this was a comfortable place for it, and they had enough food for a while.</p><hr>

<p>The next couple of days were about as peaceful as they could be.</p>

<p>Here they were seemingly isolated from the rest of the island, safe in their own secluded little oasis, and it was easy to forget they probably had a bounty on their heads elsewhere by now. If he hadn't still had the urgency to return back home, Archer might have even been satisfied there.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Archer imagined what must be happening back home and what they must think of his having vanished. He'd now been absent for a week or so; Giovanni and the rest of Team Rocket had to be searching for him.</p>

<p>Archer had always been the impatient sort. He was cold enough to analyze things first, but once he decided on a course of action he quickly sprang to fulfill it. Now he was currently in a state of pending, where he knew he wanted to return home yet had no way to do so, and he knew the Unowns were being held somewhere yet had no idea how to figure out where they were. This fact made him antsy.</p>

<p>At least the animals were content. It was tranquil here in Bamboo Groves and the only other wildlife they'd encountered so far acted friendly towards their pets. It struck Archer though that any time they saw him or Zoe, they bolted.</p>

<p>That particular morning he'd been watching a cluster of wild Bellossom – apparently here they were called Bristla? and they had thorns? – happily playing with Houndoom, Pengullet, and Tanzee near the pond. The moment he stepped into view, the little flower-like creatures startled and scattered into the bracken.</p>

<p>"I don't know…" Archer remarked, as he watched one of the Bristla peek out from where it was hiding in the bushes and then duck back down when it saw they were still there, "it seems like every wild animal on this island is either extremely frightened of humans or overly eager to run us off."</p>

<p>"All Pals are like that, unless they have a tamer," Zoe shrugged.</p>

<p>"It's not like that on the mainland." And once again he chided himself for his own stubborn considerations. This was not the mainland; he needed to stop thinking it would be like the mainland. That's why he wanted to get back home.</p>

<p>Frostallion's wing was healing fast. Archer had found some medicinal herbs growing near the cliff, or rather Houndoom had found them after perusing the area and alerted him. By crushing the herbs it was an easy affair to make a salve that could be spread on the injury.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon you'll be able to fly again," Archer told it.</p>

<p>The horse gave a happy neigh.</p>

<p>"Then you can fly me up high so I can see what we've got around these parts," Archer added, thinking aloud. "With a little luck I'll see a boat or something that I can steal and get off this damn island. I'm going to take you with me."</p>

<p>To which Frostallion gave a displeased snort.</p>

<p>Archer considered the Pegasus. He couldn't understand what it was saying, but of all the animals they had, it made one of the most determined attempts to communicate, and he could hazard a guess. "Don't tell me you actually like living on this island?"</p>

<p>Frostallion gave a shake of its head and pawed the ground with a hoof. It nodded its head towards a direction, and Archer followed the gesture to see the faraway mountain peak rising beyond the bamboo trees.</p>

<p>"Is that where you lived?" he asked it.</p>

<p>"It makes sense…" said Zoe pensively. "The mountains rise so high that the top peaks can get snow, so its one of the only places that you can find ice types. There's also a great statue of a Frostallion erected in the depths of the woods. The ancient people credited Frostallions as powerful war-horses that helped them repel threats to our island."</p>

<p>The Pegasus seemed to like the story she was saying and was now strutting around, shaking its ice-encrusted mane impressively.</p>

<p>"So you want to return to living as a wild Pokémon on the mountain," Archer deduced, turning back to Frostallion.</p>

<p>Frostallion whinnied happily.</p>

<p>"Well…too bad," replied Archer flippantly.</p>

<p>To which Frostallion gave him a sideways look that could be described as nothing else but a scowl.</p>

<p>Archer was wholly indifferent. "You don't find an ice type Rapidash every day and I'm not about to let one go just because its homesick."</p>

<p>Zoe pointed out the irony. "<i>You're</i> homesick," she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe, but I'm from Team Rocket and we take our own interests into account," he declared, offering the Pegasus a berry.</p>

<p>Frostallion flattened its ears but accepted the berry regardless.</p>

<p>Just then another berry came careening out of nowhere, flying towards them in mid-air. Frostallion jerked back as Archer ducked, narrowly avoiding getting hit in the head as it hurtled past him.</p>

<p>He turned to see Tanzee laughing. The monkey was hopping up and down like a taunt next to a small pile of berries it had plucked from the bushes.</p>

<p>It seized another berry in its paws and flung it at Archer. This one landed squarely on its intended target, bouncing off Archer's head and rolling onto the grass.</p>

<p>"Damn monkey, creating chaos," Archer snapped.</p>

<p>He grabbed the berry and tried to throw it back at it but Zoe laid a hand on his shoulder and stopped him. "Tanzee's only playing," she excused.</p>

<p>"He's still annoying," replied Archer, shooting a glare at the grass type. Tanzee spread its mouth wide in a mocking grin. "There's enough trouble trying to plan our next move without having to deal with unnecessary joking around."</p>

<p>"All things considered, we've been rather fortunate," Zoe pointed out. "We just have to lay low for a while."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Archer conceded. "But I don't know how long our supplies will hold out. We're out of Poké Balls. Or Pal Spheres, as everyone here calls them."</p>

<p>"That's no trouble at all!" said Zoe, with a cheerful smile, "we can make more."</p>

<p>Archer blinked in surprise. Hand-crafting Poké Balls was a rare skill on the mainland, practised by so few it was something of a lost art. "You know how to make Poké Balls?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But how do you find the materials?" he questioned, "They're not that easy to get ahold of."</p>

<p>"Sure they are. They're as abundant as the soil," she laughed in good humor.</p>

<p>Once again, he'd forgotten he was on Palpagos Island – not the Kanto region. Or any other mainland region, come to that.</p><hr>

<p>It turned out Zoe wasn't kidding when she said the materials were abundant as soil. Fragments of paldium, as Archer soon learnt was how the islanders referred to tumblestone, were easily found in the rocks, in the cliffside, and in the very ground. Digging not only provided more glistening tumblestone shards than they could ever need to make a bunch of spheres, it also unearthed shimmering dust that Archer dismissed as fools-gold before realizing with shock it was the veritable thing. The island, it seemed, was rich in natural resources.</p>

<p>"You mean to say," Archer said, as they walked over with a handful of tumblestone pieces to a wood bench beside the cabin, "that the soil has both tumblestone and gold in it?"</p>

<p>"That's just how the ground is," replied Zoe, who didn't see the big deal.</p>

<p>He thought about telling her that was special to the island before deciding it was information he'd best keep to himself till he could tell Giovanni. On the mainland, tumblestone was only found in special deposits, where it had to be mined. Gold was as scarce as...gold. And if he'd had any doubt whether seizing the territory away from Marcus Dryden would be profitable for Team Rocket, no more.</p>

<p>Besides the tumblestone, Zoe had gathered some strips of tree bark and reddish stones. Archer hadn't thought much of the stones before she asked if she could borrow Houndoom for its fire attacks, and then he realized the stones were red because they contained chunks of iron ore.</p>

<p>Smelting the iron was fairly easy with the help of Houndoom, and the amount needed to make a Poké Ball's clasping mechanism was so small it was easy for Zoe to hammer out its shape. The tumblestone was refined and hammered out in the same fashion to form a sphere, and the wood casing was layered atop it.</p>

<p>Archer watched her work with silent fascination, listening to all her explanations of the technique with genuine interest, and only speaking unprompted once. "How did you learn this?"</p>

<p>"The skill of crafting Pal Spheres has been passed down through generations in my family. Just like the task of guarding the tower," Zoe told him, and admitted, "I don't know how we came by the knowledge."</p>

<p>"So it's not something typical on the island?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not typical at all. Marcus knows too, but it's not something everyone on the island knows how to do. I don't know how he ever makes so many for his entire army, let alone to sell to the townspeople."</p>

<p>The completed Pal Spheres glistened beautifully, in the same remarkable way as all the antique-style Poké Balls he'd seen so far. They'd made about ten of them, enough in case of a drawn-out battle with a hard-to-capture beast.</p>

<p>Zoe handed Archer the spheres, and he took them gingerly; he was fully aware these had no safety fail-safe to prevent a person being taken by one, and the idea made him as observant handling the little capsules as when maneuvering a loaded gun.</p>

<p>"It's common practice in Team Rocket to always carry spare Poké Balls," Archer explained, "just in case a rare wild Pokémon appears that might be useful to the organization."</p>

<p>Even as he said this, he was starting to scheme, as any self-respecting member of Team Rocket would. He glanced up from the Pal Spheres to watch Frostallion drinking water at the pond.</p>

<p>Frostallion was, in Archer's eyes, not only rare but useful, and valuable – at the moment certainly, but it could no doubt be sold at a high price when he got home – and that would certainly be the case for <i>all</i> the creatures on this island, wouldn't it? Those shiny white Eevee for starters, and the short-eared Clefable, not to mention all the other regional forms with their different typing. He could imagine people in Kanto and Johto paying hefty sums for the rare Pokémon he'd seen here that, to the islanders, were commonplace Pals.</p>

<p>"Why don't we go out hunting later this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"For food?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "To catch some Pals."</p><h2>Chapter 9 - Supply Drop ✅</h2>

<p>Archer was annoyed.</p>

<p>For all the strange animals he'd seen from the time he'd first arrived on Palpagos Island, this afternoon they'd found not a single one. It was like they knew he was coming to catch them and they all hid. At least they saw none of Marcus' soldiers, either, so they were presently able to explore the entire area surrounding Bamboo Groves without fear of getting shot at.</p>

<p>When they didn't find anything on the meadow, they followed a grassy trail through the forest to see if any wildlife would show up there. Pengullet hopped along with them, keeping close to its tamer Zoe.</p>

<p>Eventually, Archer noticed something sifting through the thistles up ahead and he and Zoe hid behind a large boulder to observe.</p>

<p>It was a squirrel. Archer would have called it a Pachirisu, yet it had the light-green fur coloring of a Leafeon and a red gem on its forehead like that of a Persian.</p>

<p>He pointed at the animal. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"A Lifmunk," answered Zoe. "It's a grass type."</p>

<p>"Good. Houndoom's got the type advantage," Archer decided, and opened Houndoom's Poké Ball with the press of a button. The dog emerged beside him in a flare of light.</p>

<p>"Start off with Faint Attack," he ordered, "Draw it into a battle."</p>

<p>Houndoom sprang forward to tackle the Lifmunk. The squirrel lifted its head at the sound of the grass rustling under Houndoom's paws, and with a startled jump successfully dodged the attack. Houndoom turned about to try again, but instead of fighting, Lifmunk ran to flee.</p>

<p>"Don't let it get away," Archer called, and Houndoom opened its jaws and sent out a stream of fire towards the squirrel.</p>

<p>Lifmunk was surprisingly evasive, and bounded aside onto a rock before darting sideways, yet not once did Archer succeed in goading the squirrel to fight back. They ended up pursuing the small creature down the grassy path. It was about to outpace them and escape when Archer decided enough was enough of the foot chase and he hurled one of the Pal Spheres at it.</p>

<p>The capsule struck Lifmunk from behind, and pulled the little animal in with a flash of light. It fell to the grass and began shaking.</p>

<p>Never before did Archer fully appreciate the convenient simplicity of a modern Poké Ball's red indicator light. Here he had to go by the luminescence of the blue tumblestone casing. It alternated between its typical glow to being bright as a flame. He watched it intently and, right when he was sure Lifmunk had been caught, the sphere burst apart in two halves.</p>

<p>Lifmunk sprang out of captivity and, without a moment of hesitation, scurried away from Archer and Zoe into the bushes.</p>

<p>Archer grimaced as he watched the leaves settle where Lifmunk had vanished. <i>My plan to impress Giovanni with a collection of rare island Pokémon doesn't seem to be panning out today...</i></p>

<p>"Lifmunk are hard to catch if they don't want a tamer," said Zoe, breaking into his thoughts. "The good thing is that they're fairly common Pals. We'll probably find more if we keep looking."</p>

<p>Her optimism was encouraging, even though he knew the afternoon would soon be growing late. As they continued on their way, Zoe inquired, "Archer, how did you train Houndoom to obey exact commands?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Archer, perplexed.</p>

<p>"You call out attacks."</p>

<p>Archer recalled the fight back at the town, with the trainer and the Chillet, and how his opponent simply threw out the Pal Sphere and let Chillet choose what attacks to use. He hadn't thought much of it at the time, but now he deduced it must be the standard way of fighting on the island.</p>

<p>"Pokémon can fight by themselves, yet they fight better if they have a human to guide them," Archer explained. "At least that's what they always say back on the mainland. It's seen as a partnership for a reason."</p>

<p>Houndoom gave a happy bark; the dog was wagging its tail. Archer patted it on the head and added, "I've had Houndoom since he was a puppy. He was my starter Pokémon...a gift from my godfather, Giovanni. I'd like to think our training has helped him grow into a much stronger Pokémon than otherwise."</p>

<p>She seemed wistful. He cleared his throat and the air of deep recollection left her as he went on, "Anyway, humans know type matchups and strategy. We can also help Pokémon increase their attack power through more ways than one. You can certainly win in combat by letting them fight on their own, but it's supposed to be harder..." Archer hesitated here for a moment. "Why don't I teach you the mainland way of battling later?"</p>

<p>"...is it that easy?"  Zoe remarked with surprise. "The truth is I rarely battle with my Pals anyway, except for self-protection."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, it's seen like a duel to the death here or something like that. But what about battling for fun?"</p>

<p>"I've never heard of battling for fun," she said pensively, "though sometimes Pals run off by themselves and get into trouble. Especially Tanzee. It's just how Pals are; they're fighty. I guess Pokémon are the same?"</p>

<p>Pengullet was cheeping and bouncing up and down cheerfully. Zoe glanced down at the penguin and smiled. "Well, in any case Pengullet does seem to like the idea! I might take you up on that, then."</p>

<p>They recalled their pets and wandered back to the cabin, taking a scenic stroll by the coastline. It was a gorgeous day. Sun streamed through the trees, washing the sand in warm light and outlining the ocean horizon in a myriad of colors; waves rolled peacefully onto the shore, carrying with them the salty scent of the surf. Once or twice a Mantine –  here known as a Celaray – could be observed to leap out from the sea at a distance. The creature caught the air under its fins, in a way Archer had never seen ray-fish do back home, and was able to glide on the wind for a short distance before splashing back into the water.</p>

<p>The beach on Palpagos Island was one of the most beautiful Archer had ever visited, and this was considering his past travels to many other known tropical regions. Every time they walked by the seashore, however, something never failed to catch his eye.</p>

<p>All along the beach there were fairly large rocks made of pure, shimmering tumblestone, carved into rough pyramids and placed in a line, at perfect margins of approximately four feet from each other and one foot from the water at high-tide, as if meant to mark where the sea began. At first Archer had not paid attention and discounted it as a curiosity of the terrain; however the more time he spent on the island, the more he started to notice how this was the case anywhere the land met the ocean, and the boulders were too precisely placed to have been naturally occurring. They had to have been put there by man. So today, when they stopped underneath some of the palm trees for a brief rest, he made a comment about them to Zoe.</p>

<p>She was ambivalent. "They're just there, I guess."</p>

<p>"Like the tower?" Archer prompted. "Someone had to have put them there."</p>

<p>"No one remembers," Zoe conceded.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the least bit curious who or why?"</p>

<p>"Whoever did it, it's lost to history by now."</p>

<p><i>If so, that's a loss,</i> Archer reflected. The stones did look rather weathered from time, evidently having stood as sentinels here for many long years. Even though they all shared the same pyramid shape, some of them had blunt peaks because of the elements' erosion. Nevertheless, they were still tumblestone, and such massive boulders of the same mineral used in Poké Balls and all technology that manipulated properties of physics must surely contain high, latent energy within them. <i>They must have had a reason for putting these here, and not just for looks. I suppose it's one of the island's mysteries.</i></p>

<p>Irrelevantly perhaps, Archer remembered the strange graffiti he'd seen scrawled on the side of the tower when he had first arrived to the island.</p>

<p>"Did the Syndicate write that saying on the side of the tower?" he asked. "The tower is the key, the trees hold the truth."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, with interest, "I didn't even know someone had painted something there."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," Archer said. "I was kind of hoping you would know what it meant." Though, he had to admit to himself, she and the rest of the people here seemed to know very little about the island they lived on; it perhaps was folly to assume she would know anything about even this.</p>

<p>Zoe frowned. "I'm just angry someone defaced our tower."</p>

<p>"But it sounds like it might mean something. You don't know what the tower is for, after all."</p>

<p>"I just know we have to protect it. Though I do think it's too bad we have no way inside," she said. "If we could get in, I think it would be easier to defend it."</p>

<p>"You can't get in?"</p>

<p>"The door is locked."</p>

<p>"Haven't you tried to break in?"</p>

<p>"It's the sacred tower." She looked affronted that he'd even considered it.</p>

<p>"The letter I on the top is glowing. How can it be glowing if there's no electric power going to it?" Archer pointed out. "If there's electric power going to the tower, then someone has to have access."</p>

<p>Zoe's eyes flew open wide. "Do you mean someone might be sneaking into our tower?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer, now searching the landscape with a focus on the trees. There was certainly some mystery to the island's tower, but it was only one half of the enigma. <i>The tower is the key...the trees hold the truth...</i></p>

<p>He started with the palm fronds overhead, but when nothing there seemed out of the ordinary he continued to examine the other trees along the coast. His eyes drifted up to the forested cliffs bordering the beach, and then he froze.</p>

<p>The trees there were also in a perfect line, as if aligned with the boulders, and at the very top of each of the trees – only partially hidden by the upper branches – was what looked undeniably like cell tower antennas.</p>

<p>He motioned towards them. "What are those?"</p>

<p>Zoe looked completely indifferent. "Tree tops."</p>

<p>"Those aren't tree tops. They don't look like any other trees here," Archer pointed out.</p>

<p>"All the trees that grow along the edge of the cliffs look like that. ...Archer, where are you going?" she asked as he got up from where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see what's up there."</p>

<p>They got up from where they were seated under the palms and ascended the cliff. Once they were at the top, he picked out one of the trees that had plenty of branches to get a foothold; then he started to climb.</p>

<p>Zoe lingered below, looking up. "Be careful you don't fall," she called to him.</p>

<p>"I won't fall," he replied, all attention on the mysterious contrivance at the topmost branches.</p>

<p>The closer he got, the more he could see they <i>were</i> antennas. Half of their faces were positioned towards the seashore, as if aimed at the stones, while the others were pointed inland. They looked either brand new or well-maintained, yet right when he was about to reach them they seemed to ripple as if behind a curtain of invisible energy and faded, as if all this time they had been a mirage.</p>

<p>Archer held back a curse. "The damn thing vanished right in front of me."</p>

<p>"I still see it from here," said Zoe.</p>

<p>The harsh sound of propellers cut through the air. He lifted his gaze to the sky right as an airplane flew directly overhead. It headed all the way to a midpoint between where they were and the distant tower; out from the hold came a large parcel of some kind, which plummeted to the ground. The airplane circled around once and receded into the clouds.</p>

<p>Archer frowned and made a mental note to investigate that next. But first he wanted to finish investigating whether the antenna was indeed still atop the tree.</p>

<p>He did little more than reach out to where it had been visible that a sudden jolt of lightning pierced his hand; electricity burned outwards and he lost his balance with a gasp and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Zoe was immediately at his side. "Archer…! Are you all right?"</p>

<p>He sat up groaning and looked up at the tree top, where the antenna was once again visible.</p>

<p>"Did you see the airplane that flew by?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It dropped something that way." He pulled himself to his feet, trying to shake away the disorientation from the shock. "Let's go see what it is."</p>

<p>Archer took the lead, hurrying his pace through tangles of bracken and ivy, as he and Zoe went to see what in the world that airplane had dumped on the ground. He hadn't voiced his suspicions, but he had a hunch about what it could be, and if he was right then it would help them enormously.</p>

<p>"Propeller airplanes come by pretty frequently, and they typically drop something," Zoe explained as they walked. "Everyone knows it's the PIDF, because only the island rulership is permitted to have airplanes. We've always presumed they're conducting training exercises."</p>

<p>"I call bullshit on that," declared Archer, "My guess is those airplanes depart from some mainland region and come here to make a delivery."</p>

<p>They came to a large clearing where a huge chest of some kind had struck the ground. There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>"I guess no one has arrived yet," Archer observed.</p>

<p>Archer quickly dashed out to the chest. A worried Zoe lingered behind in the bushes, keeping lookout.</p>

<p>It was a massive trunk with an elaborate numerical lock, one which upon further examination Archer didn't think there was enough time to pick. He retrieved and opened Houndoom's Poké Ball, sending out the canine.</p>

<p>"Houndoom," he addressed his Pokémon, "see if you can get this damn thing open."</p>

<p>Houndoom gave a rough bark in reply and complied, tacking the container headlong. Despite impressive looks, the locking  mechanism snapped apart easily and Archer was able to open the lid.</p>

<p>Within the chest, Archer discovered a treasure trove of unusual items. What struck his attention first were several packages of ammunition, stacked one atop the other in the corner. <i>Best of all, it's the ammunition used by the machine gun we've stolen,</i> Archer realized, and immediately set to pocketing them. <i>Jackpot!</i></p>

<p>The next thing that caught his eye were many small metal barrels, easily half the size of a can of soda, ringed with glowing tumblestone; he realized they were using the tumblestone as in a Poké Ball to shrink their size, so they would likely have been much, much larger and heavier had it not been for that. They looked like tiny oil barrels, and as he examined them he discovered that yes, they did in fact contain crude oil.</p>

<p><i>What the fuck do you need so much crude oil for?</i> he thought, deciding to pocket them too for the hell of it.</p>

<p>The last things they had here were basic medicinal spray-potions, of the type commonly used on the mainland, and blueprints of some kind. Just the idea of having proper medicine for their pets was a boon, and he took them all; as for the blueprints he felt he didn't have enough time to figure out what they were for, so he figured he'd better take them as well.</p>

<p>That left the big chest empty, and as Archer stood up he could hear leaves rustling and people talking in the island language as a group approached the clearing. With a sly smile, he and Houndoom darted back into the bracken where Zoe was waiting for him.</p>

<p>"What did you find?" she asked with curiosity, but he motioned for her to stay silent and hidden.</p>

<p>Only a instant later soldiers wearing PIDF uniforms arrived. The moment they saw the chest open they ran to it and, seeing their bounty pilfered, readied their guns and set off to search for the thief, one of them shouting out angry orders to the rest.</p>

<p>Archer snickered to see the turmoil he'd instigated. "Come on, let's go."</p>

<p>As they fled through the forest, placing distance between themselves and the raided chest – even though the soldiers had no idea where to look for the culprit – Archer was laughing. He and Zoe headed off happily on their way back to the cabin, and as they did he told her about all the items being sent in the supply drop that were now in their possession.</p>

<p>"Crude oil?" Zoe had the same reaction. "Why do they need crude oil?"</p>

<p>"No idea."</p>

<p>"Why do <i>we</i> need crude oil?"</p>

<p>"Even less idea. But if they want it so bad then we may as well have it on our side. You said you've seen propeller airplanes drop parcels often?"</p>

<p>"At least once a week," she affirmed.</p>

<p>"Good. If we keep track of their supply shipments, we ought to have enough potions and ammo to survive comfortably and eventually launch an all-out attack on that asshole Marcus' stronghold so I can steal a boat."</p>

<p>"I thought you were also going to drive him off? Not just steal a boat?" Zoe prodded.</p>

<p>"If we kill him, that's just as good," Archer replied.</p>

<p>That logic seemed to satisfy her, and as Archer and Zoe turned a corner they could see some of the soldiers had looped around and were searching up ahead. A couple of them had sent out their Direhowl, which were now sniffing the air trying to get a scent.</p>

<p>Archer scowled. "Shit, they move fast don't they? Thank God we're downwind from them."</p>

<p>"This way," said Zoe, motioning away from the wolves and their tamers.</p>

<p>She led Archer towards a steep embankment and started climbing, with him following suit and his Houndoom clambering behind as well. They reached a cliff that connected with another one and they kept going. After several minutes of climbing, Archer was getting fed up and called Houndoom back into its Poké Ball so his dog could rest.</p>

<p>Eventually they arrived at a strange site that bore a sign that read 'No Trespassing' in Unown letters, with the PIDF insignia right below. It looked decrepit and about to fall apart.</p>

<p>"How far did we walk?" muttered Archer, gasping to reclaim his breath.</p>

<p>"I think we're at the base of the Astral Mountains," considered Zoe. "You know if they catch us here, we'll disappear."</p>

<p>"We'll <i>disappear</i> wherever they catch us," Archer dismissed, and pressed onward ahead of her. "Why don't they want people up here?"</p>

<p>"They say the ground is radioactive. No one really knows though...rumor has it the ancient people had a small settlement up on the mountain but it was destroyed by alien Pals from the sky."</p>

<p>Archer half-smiled disbelievingly at the idea; it sounded like something straight out of a science fiction film.</p>

<p>Cold wind carried itself down from the mountain peak, a sharp weather difference from the pure tropics of the lowlands. The foliage, in turn, gradually intermingled the trees with temperate pines as the ground began to slope upward. They eventually began to follow a stream upriver, all the way to a waterfall that gurgled down the rocks, and when they climbed this they encountered such an unexpected sight both Archer and Zoe halted in their tracks.</p>

<p>It was an abandoned city of some kind. Tall buildings, overgrown with ivy and moss, stood at attention alongside wide streets as monuments to a forgotten civilization. Antiquated traffic lights lay in disarray across grey cobblestone and at short distances on either side were the remnants of tethering-posts, calling to mind once-bustling thoroughfares traversed both by early automobiles and large Pokémon. It looked like a manmade waterway had, at one point in time, also meandered through the city beside pedestrian paths, but now the water was still and a thin layer of algae had taken form, while the sidewalks were interspersed with overtaking grass and cracking from disuse.</p>

<p>Animals still lived here evidently; every so often they spied a wayward Lifmunk or a bovine Mozzarina roaming around the landscape. Strange but beautiful flowers bloomed sparingly through cracks in the stone, their gentle fragrance carrying on the wind.</p>

<p>The flowers were so unique that Archer nearly stopped in his tracks to examine them. He came very close to picking one to get a closer look, yet Zoe stopped him. "Don't touch the plants."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"...I don't know. That type of flower is considered sacred, for some reason. I've never seen it in person."</p>

<p>Archer gave it a skeptical look but decided to let the flowers be.</p>

<p>As they walked around the site, staring incredulously at these remnants of a lost period in the island's history, Archer began to think about Zoe's earlier comment regarding rumors of alien Pals and the decimation of settlements. Eternatus, an alien Pokémon that nearly destroyed the entire Galar region, came fleetingly to mind. Yet Archer didn't think this was the case here.</p>

<p>In the first place this wasn't a 'small' settlement by any means; it was a large city that once upon a time might have rivalled Goldenrod or Saffron on the mainland. In the second, this city wasn't decimated; in fact it was too preserved, too unspoiled, for a catastrophe of that magnitude to have befallen here. There most certainly had been some kind of a war, as evidenced by fallen debris and possible shrapnel, but it appeared the invaders had quickly won – perhaps by the city's surrender. The rest of the damage looked as if it was nature's fault, as if both vanquished and victors had inexplicably departed the city soon thereafter and left it to be reclaimed by the elements.</p>

<p><i>Of course, like so many things on this island, the only people who would've known for sure are long dead and gone,</i> Archer lamented silently as he and Zoe stopped at what once must have been a vibrant city plaza. <i>But I can't help but think these alien stories were conjured up to keep the islanders from learning some secret.</i></p>

<p>Zoe was still gazing at the buildings, aghast. "I've never seen such a huge place. It's like every building is as tall as our tower. How many people must have lived here...?"</p>

<p>"The buildings are so high it's hard to see just how big the place is," said Archer, "or for that matter how far we've walked from the cabin. Hold on...I've got an idea."</p>

<p>He retrieved Frostallion's Poké Ball and opened it with the press of a button. The Pegasus appeared beside him and gave a neigh.</p>

<p>"Is your wing still hurting you?" Archer asked it, and Frostallion extended the wing for him to see. The graze was steadily getting better, but now they had a much faster way to treat it.</p>

<p>He took out one of the potions he had stolen from the supply drop and sprayed a couple of spritzes on Frostallion's wing. Immediately, the injury faded away before their eyes. Archer was used to seeing this kind of rapid recovery, however Zoe was not, and she gave a surprised gasp.</p>

<p>"The wound is totally healed!" she exclaimed. "It's like it was never injured."</p>

<p>"Chalk one up for modern civilization," Archer replied. "These are the same kinds of Full Restores they sell back home."</p>

<p>"You mean they've got medicine that can heal in the blink of an eye?" Zoe marvelled. "I can't believe they've been keeping it for themselves all this time."</p>

<p>"Funny how a vantage point makes such a difference," considered Archer, regarding the little spray bottle wryly. "On the mainland, tumblestone is scarce and potions can be bought for two dollars at the corner mart. Here precious minerals are everywhere and good medicine is a thing of fantasy." He then turned and addressed Frostallion. "How's your wing feeling now?"</p>

<p>The horse gave a happy neigh and flapped its wings.</p>

<p>"I need you to fly us up high so we can see where we are," Archer added, and he and Zoe got on the Pegasus' back and the horse stretched its wings and flew up.</p>

<p>They rose to the top of one of the tallest buildings there, and as Frostallion landed lightly on the rooftop, its hooves clattering on the smooth ground, Archer noticed that a large Unown letter H was painted in the center of the wide space. They were on an old helicopter landing.</p>

<p>That discovery, however, wasn't nearly as stunning as when they proceeded to dismount Frostallion and get a good look around at the view.</p>

<p>They stared in awe, mystified by the sight. There was the Syndicate's tower in the far distance, and from the very top radiated a glowing energy that rippled across the entire island, pulled towards the antennas on the trees before being sent, like a relay, down to the pyramidal rocks at the edge of the island on the seashore, and then outwards to the ocean. Far into the water, the energy flashed upwards like a translucent red curtain and dissipated into the sky.</p>

<p>"What the hell are we looking at?" Zoe asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," replied Archer, "but I'm going to find out."</p><h2>Chapter 10 - Tocotoco Raid ✅</h2>

<p>On their way back to the cabin, Archer and Zoe talked. They discussed the energy field they had seen spreading outwards from the tower and questioned what it could be for; they also talked about Archer's original plan of stealing a boat.</p>

<p>"So, are you going after a boat or checking on this antenna? ...I won't even ask you at this point about fighting Marcus because it looks like there's a lot of new stuff turning up," Zoe said.</p>

<p>"First thing should be looking into this antenna atop the tower and what it does," Archer replied.</p>

<p>Investigating the antenna was less a matter of getting off the island and more of curiosity, and maybe even a bit of spite. <i>No one</i> kept a Team Rocket agent stranded and incommunicado on an island in the middle of nowhere. Since these people were making it difficult for him, he might as well stir up some trouble here and show them what the world's most glorious crime organization was capable of – even if right now it was just him. <i>Oh, if I only had an entire squadron of our agents here,</i> Archer imagined, <i>I'd really give these fools a run for their money.</i></p>

<p>When they arrived at the cabin, Archer immediately spread the bounty taken from the supply drop on the table and went to load their gun with the ammunition. "It's always safer to be ready," Archer explained.</p>

<p>Zoe went outside to let all the animals out of their spheres, swiftly returning to Archer's side as he finished reloading the weapon. They then began looking over the rest of the items together. "It really is a lot," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Whomever's making these supply drops has to be from the mainland," Archer reasoned. "That means someone out there knows about this island."</p>

<p>He hadn't had a good chance to look over the stolen blueprints till now. They were schematics, seemingly outlining some kind of weaponry, but they were far too technical for him to understand. No doubt Team Rocket's scientists back home could interpret it.</p>

<p><i>Giovanni would be doubly impressed if he could see all this,</i> he thought, only to get annoyed once again at being unable to get word to Team Rocket headquarters.</p>

<p>In the corner of each of the documents was a peculiar logo, which Archer thought looked incredibly familiar yet could not place at a glance. It was a horizontal semicircle with a star piercing its center, flaring outwards in either direction like the hands of a clock marking five minutes to the hour of five.</p>

<p><i>Damn, I know I've seen it somewhere,</i> thought Archer, considering the insignia carefully; it was like a word held on the tip of one's tongue. <i>Maybe it'll come to me eventually.</i></p>

<p>What completely stymied him however was whatever purpose the crude oil might serve.</p>

<p>"Zoe," asked Archer, "have you ever seen any kind of reverse shipments going out? If Marcus is getting all this stuff from someone on one of the mainland regions, then that person has to be getting something in return."</p>

<p>Zoe thought about his question for a long moment. "I'm not sure," she said at last, "I know we used to see airplanes taking off near the town, at least once a month, but that stopped quite a while ago. We weren't sure where they were going…again, we imagined it was just routine training or patrols of the island."</p>

<p>"I wish you knew more about the tower."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>Somehow he hadn't expected that kind of sentiment from Zoe, or even that level of candor. He had taken her and the rest of the Syndicate as indifferent to their surroundings, so long as nothing overtly imperiled them or the tower they seemed to revere.</p>

<p>"The thing is, I feel I ought to remember…like there's something my people forgot somehow that would answer everything. Just because I don't know what's going on about the tower, or other things, doesn't mean I don't want to know," Zoe added. "On the contrary; I feel if I'm from the island, how can I not have answers to the questions you ask that seem so simple? But I'm starting to remember some things."</p>

<p>"Like what?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>"I once had a Pal…Grizzbolt…who was my close partner, like you and Houndoom."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. One day Grizzbolt vanished. I don't remember why or how…I just remember missing her a lot. I still do." Zoe glanced up at him and continued, "It was around the same time Tanzee appeared near our camp."</p>

<p>Before he could respond, they suddenly heard the guttural cry of some kind of animal off in the distance. Archer didn't recognize it, but pallor immediately came over Zoe's face. "Tocotoco."</p>

<p>"Toco-what?" Archer echoed.</p>

<p>"Tocotoco raid anywhere they think has food and leave the place obliterated." She turned towards him fearfully. "We need to get out of here. Now."</p>

<p>"That's nonsense. Can't we fight them off?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Fight off <i>Tocotoco</i>? They're worse than a rampaging Mammorest," Zoe dissuaded.</p>

<p>Despite Zoe's concerns, Archer wandered outside the cabin with Houndoom loyally at his side. Pengullet and Tanzee were already standing at alert here, visibly eager for combat. The ominous cry sounded again in closer proximity and Archer turned his attention towards it, up to the slope beyond the bamboo leaves.</p>

<p>As he watched, a small creature appeared on the rise of the hill; first one, then a few dozen. They were short, squat dodo-like birds, with the green plumage of Xatu and the blank looks of Psyduck.</p>

<p>Archer took one look at the flock and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"The way you said we were going to get raided I was expecting the cavalry, not the dodo brigade."</p>

<p>Zoe, standing at the cabin door, was serious. "They explode."</p>

<p>"They... explode?"</p>

<p>With a singular squawk of war, the Voltorb-birds raced down the hill much faster than Archer thought their chubby legs could have carried them.</p>

<p>They were making directly for the cabin.</p>

<p>Archer recognized the glow on their feathers as the precursor to the Selfdestruct attack. The air ignited around some of them in a fiery explosion, and the birds – knocked out by their own power – collapsed sideways onto the grass with exhaustion.</p>

<p>Pengullet blasted the invaders with an aimed torrent of water, which only succeeded in getting one of the Tocotoco to race up to it vengefully; its explosive attack flung the little penguin backwards. Tanzee, which had begun jeering at them, only narrowly saved itself by swinging up into the heights of one of the nearby bamboo stalks. Frostallion, evidently not in the mood for combat against exploding birds, simply fluttered into the air so as to get away from the problem.</p>

<p>"Everyone, get in the spheres!" Zoe cried, recalling both her Pals in a swift motion, although Pengullet looked like it wanted to keep fighting and Tanzee looked like it wanted to keep screeching insults from the safety of its new perch.</p>

<p>Houndoom meanwhile dashed from one side of the grassy clearing to the other on Archer's frantic directive, trying to halt the intruders with its fire attacks before they got any closer. Several particularly determined Tocotoco got past, and hurled themselves with a vengeance at the wood structure of the cabin. Archer grabbed Zoe's hand and pulled her away from the doorway, before the blast destroyed the wall surrounding it.</p>

<p>They watched from a safe distance as the place that had provided them shelter now burned. The remaining birds, seemingly satisfied with the chaos they had inflicted, dispersed.</p><hr>

<p>Archer and Zoe spent the night in the only place that had not been affected by the explosion, which was the back end of the structure. The next morning they assessed the damage and decided that reconstruction was possible but it would be more efficient to use rocks instead of wood to rebuild.</p>

<p>Construction proceeded slowly, perhaps on account of how heavy the rocks were, but there was no denying how the losing battle against "those damned dodo birds," as Archer called them, had done a number on their little party's general enthusiasm.</p>

<p>They hadn't destroyed the entire cabin, but they had damaged a large section of the right half of the building, leaving the inside open to the elements. The turn of events had entirely derailed their earlier plans to go out and check on the tower's antenna, at least for the moment. However, with the effort it took to rebuild, something else important went overlooked; the Tocotoco had succeeded in running off with most of their provisions, and Zoe eventually pointed it out.</p>

<p>"We're running short on food. We still have a few berries, but we can't survive forever on that. And your dog will need meat too."</p>

<p>"You're right," Archer conceded. "Seeing there's no way of getting anything from the village, I suppose I'll have to go out hunting."</p>

<p>"I can go; that way you can finish up the base," she offered. "...besides, you can probably carry these heavy rocks better than I can."</p>

<p>"If you're sure..."</p>

<p>Archer's voice was drowned out by rapid gunfire and infernal screeching. He looked over to see Tanzee gripping a machine gun in its paws and firing it at the trees with wild glee.</p>

<p>Archer remained skeptical. "I'm sorry....why did we give the monkey our gun, again?"</p>

<p>"So it can protect our base," replied Zoe.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust that monkey to protect shit. Look, take Houndoom with you. At least you'll have some kind of protection."</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when Zoe returned, Houndoom trotting alongside her; she was carrying an armful of shiny blue capsules. "We've got dinner! ...and enough here for half the week besides."</p>

<p>Archer couldn't believe it. "You caught them...in Poké Balls?"</p>

<p>"Pal Spheres. Yes. How else?"</p>

<p>"If you're going to eat them you don't catch them in Poké Balls, damn it. No wonder the island animals don't trust humans...they have no way to know if they're destined to be pets or on the menu."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you get meat in your world?"</p>

<p>"We raise livestock on farms, like civilized people. Otherwise if you're out in the jungle you set traps."</p>

<p>"Spheres are traps," said Zoe blankly.</p>

<p>Archer sighed, pressing his hand to his eyes like if he was trying to fend off a bad headache. "Let me see what you caught."</p>

<p>She tossed the Pal Spheres happily and a flock of three or four small, white-plumed chickens emerged.</p>

<p>"They're..." Archer glanced tentatively at her, knowing by now they were probably called a different name than the species he'd been about to say.</p>

<p>"Chikipi," Zoe replied promptly.</p>

<p>One of the chickens hopped over to Archer, looked up at him, and leant against his leg in a hug.</p>

<p>Archer glanced from the Chikipi back to Zoe. "We're not eating them. We now have an egg farm."</p>

<p>"...and you say you worked as an assassin?"</p>

<p>"I was a businessman."</p>

<p>"Right..."</p>

<p>"Later we'll go out to the forest again and I'll show you a better way to hunt food."</p><hr>

<p>Archer did not disappoint, and not long afterwards he set out with supplies, Zoe following curiously to see what kind of trap he'd devise. He didn't go very far from the cabin, and the bamboo thicket with the pond was still in view when he stopped and began construction by the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>"Two of my old colleagues preferred pitfall traps," he recounted to her, trying to hide his wistfulness, "but I've always found they can be fickle when it comes to weight. The way this one works is...anything that crosses over here will get ensnared, causing the stone to drop and yanking it up by a leg."</p>

<p>"What are you planning to trap?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"I saw a wild hog near the tree-line yesterday. It looked like a Piloswine but leaner."</p>

<p>"A Rushoar?"</p>

<p>"Sure, why not. The point is I want bacon."</p>

<p>With the trap set, they strolled back to the cabin. The day had felt long and it vaguely surprised Archer that only now was the sun beginning to set. He could see some of the wildlife settling beneath trees and in nests to sleep for the night, while nocturnal species were beginning to emerge for their shadowy prowls. Were it not for the hardships of such an isolated life, the inability to contact headquarters, and maybe the people out to kill them, Archer imagined this island would be a veritable paradise.</p><hr>

<p>The sun was bright this afternoon and Jett was in her office reviewing business papers regarding recently acquired properties that were to be developed under her orders. The telephone rang at that moment.</p>

<p>"Marcus? I'm surprised to hear from you. It must be midnight on your part of the globe," Jett remarked, with a glance first at her watch and then at the clock on the wall.</p>

<p>"I wanted to make sure I'd get you on the phone," said Marcus, "I need a copy of the schematics to be sent."</p>

<p>"You haven't received the shipment?"</p>

<p>"It was stolen from us."</p>

<p>"Stolen? How could <i>anyone</i> there steal it from your people?" Doubt filtered through her voice.</p>

<p>"There's an outsider who landed here. He's dumb enough to think he can cause trouble."</p>

<p>"An...outsider? Who, some castaway?"</p>

<p>He dismissed her worries without hesitation. "It's nothing to be concerned with."</p>

<p>"So long as it's not someone who can find his way back to whatever region he came from," she said.</p>

<p>"Not at all. You know I have my place isolated. He's as good as dead."</p>

<p>Jett narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. She wasn't sure if to fully believe Marcus about this, but he did sound certain of himself, so she didn't pursue the issue further.</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can arrange," she replied simply, "I'll call you once I have the second drop scheduled."</p>

<p>Jett hung up the telephone, and went on to make the necessary arrangements, but thought little more of it afterwards. She was turning back to her regular office work when Johnston, the construction crew foreman, walked in.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Silph," he announced, "There's been another wild Pokémon attack."</p>

<p>She stared at him incredulously. "Not again?"</p>

<p>"This one was an Altaria, but I'd never seen one so angry! It fluffed out its feathers to twice its size. The damned bird used a Twister attack that was so powerful it tore off half the new awning we'd installed on the shopping center we'd just about finished building."</p>

<p>"I imagine it put the progress on that construction back considerably," concluded Jett.</p>

<p>Johnston's grim features affirmed her suspicions. "A combined effort of our own Pokémon chased it off, but just barely," he continued, "No one outside of Quasartico employees has seen these rogue Pokémon, yet. But if this keeps happening someone in the public will."</p>

<p>Jett inwardly cringed. "That's what I'm afraid of. People will certainly make an issue out of it."</p>

<p>As Johnston left, Jett leant back in her chair pensively. <i>Here I was hoping the situation with the rogue wild Pokémon wouldn't be repeated. I need to figure out what to do about this.</i></p><h2>Chapter 11 - Ensnared ✅</h2>

<p>The day dawned sunny in Lumiose City. Jett was in her office early as she did often and her dog Pokémon Furfrou was with her. She had placed a food dish for her pet on the floor next to her desk and the poodle was happily eating its breakfast, while Jett looked over some business papers.</p>

<p>The dog finished eating quickly. "All done Furfrou?" she asked.</p>

<p>Furfrou barked affirmation and wagged its tail.</p>

<p>She picked up the dish and placing it on her desk, remarked, "You have some leftovers; perhaps I should get you a flavor you like better." She recalled the Pokémon back into its Poké Ball, right as her intercom beeped and she pressed the button on the small console to answer it.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Silph, there is a gentleman here in the reception area...Mr. Corbeau...he requests a word with you and he says it is important."</p>

<p>"I will be right out," she replied.</p>

<p>Jett placed the papers she was reviewing into a small pile and placed them at the center of her desk. She briefly looked at the window and saw that sunshine was beginning to peek in, and at this point she looked at the plant that was on her desk.</p>

<p><i>Maybe I should put it near the window, so it gets some sun,</i> she thought. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said aloud to herself, "I have no time for this now; Corbeau is waiting."</p>

<p>She left the office and found Corbeau sitting near the reception desk. He stood up when she entered the room.</p>

<p>"It's quite early Corbeau, is something the matter?"</p>

<p>"I've brought you the documentation regarding the acquisition of the buildings around Prism Tower. It's imperative that you sign it so that it can be notarized...that paves the way for you to take control of all of the surrounding area quickly and do what you will with it."</p>

<p>"That's excellent news!" she exclaimed, "That takes care of the entire center of Lumiose at once!"</p>

<p>A notary from an adjacent office was called in, and after Jett had signed the documents, it was official. Jett now was free to do as she pleased with both Prism Tower and the adjacent structures.</p>

<p>"This is a splendid turn of events, Corbeau!" she said happily, "We must celebrate! Perhaps a group dinner, a select group of your people and a few of my employees... I will pay the costs."</p>

<p>"Great idea Jett," he answered, "except it will have to wait, as I have plans for today. Nevertheless...remember you owe me two favors now."</p>

<p>She smiled, and he walked away, waving as he stepped out the office doorway.</p>

<p>Jett went back into her office with a spring in her step, but as soon as she sat down at her desk she noticed that some of the tendrils of the flower had entwined around the dish. The blossom had closed.</p>

<p>She took the dish away quizzically, and stared at the flower for a while. The leftovers on the dish were gone.</p>

<p>She shook her head and decided to just plow ahead with her work, so she picked up the potted plant and put it near the sunny window and didn't pay much attention to the plant for the rest of the day. By the late afternoon, she decided it had been a busy day and as she gathered her things to go home, she glanced at the plant and was stunned at what she saw.</p>

<p>The plant had grown another six inches in the time she had placed it in sunshine. Approximately an inch, an hour. <i>That's impossible.</i> she thought. But yet, there it was, undeniably larger than before.</p>

<p>"I'll just have it repotted," she mumbled to herself, "Tomorrow I'll talk to Seymore."</p>

<p>She picked up her things and shutting the office lights walked out closing the door behind her. The plant's flower opened and stretched its stalk so that it stood up straight.</p><hr>

<p>Early at dawn, Archer and Zoe set off for the island tower astride Frostallion. The Pegasus galloped a short distance from the cabin before it took wing, soaring above the trees with its two riders.</p>

<p>This was the first time Archer had really gotten a chance to enjoy flying over the island. The landscape was beautifully pristine, with sprawling, palm-scattered beaches and unspoiled woodland that rivalled known regions' most splendid forest routes. As they neared the tower, they could see the small plume of smoke from the Syndicate's village campfire, and off in the distance was the town where they'd met Marcus Dryden.</p>

<p>Guiding Frostallion, Archer flew all the way to the top of the tower and circled the building. The strange energy field shooting upwards was invisible at this proximity, but the antenna was there – pointing up to the sky, itself radiating with an orange glow apparently impossible to hide.</p>

<p>Just then, he heard a small bleating sound and turned his attention to the small figure near the edge of the rooftop.</p>

<p>It was a bipedal Wooloo. Or rather, as Archer had found out they were called on the island, a Lamball. The little rotund sheep, objectively cute and innocuous-looking, was incongruently stationed next to a massive gatling gun.</p>

<p>"Shit!" Archer exclaimed, pulling back on the reins just as the Lamball struck the trigger with its hooves and fired at them.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were amidst a cyclone of bullets; Frostallion plunged down evasively and they dove below the gunfire. Its hooves clattered on the ground as they landed safely in front of the tower's locked door.</p>

<p>Archer glanced up as the gunfire ceased. "Zoe, if we had any question left, I think it's safe to say someone is inside that tower. That damned sheep wouldn't put itself up there, let alone with a war weapon."</p>

<p>They heard shouts and turned to see people from the Syndicate encampment come running. Zoe hopped down from Frostallion to meet them.</p>

<p>They spoke in the island language, which to Archer remained melodious but incomprehensible. Eventually Zoe turned towards Archer.</p>

<p>"They say we should avoid disturbing the tower lest we get cursed."</p>

<p>"Bullshit," Archer snapped. "Tell them that's a lot of stupid superstition."</p>

<p>Zoe started to turn but then hesitated and glanced back at him. "…I don't know if they'd take that the wrong way."</p>

<p>"Tell them there's a trigger-happy Wooloo on the roof."</p>

<p>She turned back to the group, speaking quickly. The response she got back from them was lacklustre, but they dispersed without much further discussion.</p><hr>

<p>Archer and Zoe returned to the cabin feeling no less closer to any progress. The trap they had set for the wild Rushoar still hadn't caught anything, either.</p>

<p>"I guess we can't do anything for the moment," Archer said sourly, trudging ahead to the cabin.</p>

<p>Zoe, seeing his disappointment, held him back. "It'll work out. In any event, the day's still young… Weren't you going to teach me how the mainland people battle with their Pals?" she reminded him.</p>

<p>Archer – after considering the matter – figured some lighthearted Pokémon training might very well do him good. At least it was a way to get his mind off problems that had no solution.</p>

<p>They decided to use the grassy clearing outside of the cabin as their battlefield. Houndoom would face Pengullet in their first training session, while Frostallion lingered on the sidelines curiously. Tanzee was uninterested, preferring to go off gathering berries from some of the bushes outlying the cabin.</p>

<p>"So every Pokémon knows four attacks," Archer began. "The trick to battling the mainland way is to pick attacks that take advantage of your opponent's type weakness…or, barring this, to increase your own strengths and evasion."</p>

<p>"I think Pengullet only knows three skills," Zoe said, glancing at the little penguin.</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Aqua Gun, Iceberg, and Bubble Blast."</p>

<p>"For the sake of this training, and if Pengullet agrees, we'll use the names those attacks are called on the mainland… Water Gun, Ice Beam, and Bubble Beam."</p>

<p>"How come?"</p>

<p>"Well, this is the mainland battling style. You may as well call out attacks by their mainland names. For that matter, Pengullet is a Piplup."</p>

<p>"I think Pengullet is a Pengullet."</p>

<p>"You know what? Piplup, Pengullet, it's all the same. As far as fighting technique goes, it's the sort of thing you can see better in practice." He motioned to the battlefield before them, ceding the starting play to her. "You have the first move."</p>

<p>Pengullet readied itself for the directive. It was visibly eager for the battle; the little creature usually fought so assuredly by itself, but now it was trying its best to follow Zoe's commands.</p>

<p>"Aqua Gun!" Zoe said.</p>

<p>"Houndoom, to the right; counter with Faint Attack," Archer called.</p>

<p>Pengullet aimed its attack, and Houndoom leapt aside towards the right, avoiding the stream of water that hit the ground where it had been standing. The dog then rushed forward, catching Pengullet off-guard in a tackle and sending the penguin tumbling headlong backwards.</p>

<p>"In a battle of this sort," Archer explained, "you not just have to account for your own offensive, but what your opponent might use as their counter-strategy." He turned back to his Pokémon.</p>

<p>"Faint Attack again. Try to pin Pengullet down."</p>

<p>The dog shifted its weight before the leap, and that was when Zoe saw a chance.</p>

<p>"Now…Aqua Gun! Direct at Houndoom!" she ordered.</p>

<p>The water attack struck Houndoom headlong in mid-pounce and the dog crashed to the ground, allowing Pengullet to bounce aside. Houndoom shook its soaking fur off.</p>

<p>"Like that?" Zoe tipped her head.</p>

<p>"Not bad," Archer complimented. "See, it's not too difficult."</p>

<p>The sound of rustling leaves and an unfamiliar man's voice drew everyone to attention.</p>

<p>"Hello! I'm selling wares! Perhaps you'd like to look at some of the merchandise I bring?"</p>

<p>The man had very pale green hair, upon which rested a tricorn hat with a single feather. He wore an ornately embroidered green overcoat with tall boots, and carried a large knapsack topped by a rolled-up sleeping bag, making him look like a unique cross between an adventuring trainer and a historical re-enactor trying to emulate the pirate days. Notably however, he did not have any Pal Spheres with him, so it ruled out at least one of the two.</p>

<p>Archer was leery, and as soon as the visitor wasn't paying attention, he whispered to Zoe, "I don't trust this guy."</p>

<p>"Wandering merchants are typical on the island," Zoe told him. "There are so many people who live far from town, travelling salesmen are often the only way for them to get supplies."</p>

<p>"As long as he really is a salesman...let's say he is...he might tell other people where we are," insisted Archer.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a danger," Zoe insisted.</p>

<p>Archer glanced over at the wandering merchant, who was lingering around the pond interacting with their curious pets. Maybe he did just want to sell items and go on his way. There was no faulting a man who just wanted to make an honest living. But Archer, who did not make an <i>honest</i> living by any semblance of the saying, had a natural wariness that was difficult to put aside.</p>

<p>Houndoom, in any event, seemed to share his uncertainties. The dog distanced himself from the other animals, watching the newcomer with thinly veiled distrust. When the man walked closer, the Pokémon growled at him.</p>

<p>"Look," Archer pointed out to Zoe, "Even Houndoom distrusts him."</p>

<p>Houndoom's growls went disregarded. Tanzee had apparently returned from its berry-picking and was now scampering around the man, while the happy-go-lucky Pengullet looked open to make a new friend, and Frostallion was indifferent but otherwise willing to tolerate anyone interested in admiring its majesty. The merchant turned away from the animals as Zoe wandered nearer.</p>

<p>"Take a look, Miss" the salesman said to Zoe, "perhaps there is something that attracts your attention; we can bargain with the price." He smiled at her and immediately Archer felt irritation rise up inside. <i>Why the smile? He's definitely up to no good.</i></p>

<p>Zoe perused his assortment of items; meanwhile Archer watched skeptically from afar, fully expecting enemies to descend on them at any moment. To his relief, he found everything remained as quiet and unassuming as ever.</p>

<p>She ended up buying some spices, and as the salesman went on his way, they returned to their battle training with little comment.</p>

<p>"Pengullet has to know a fourth attack," Archer considered, "it's probably something so basic that it's hard to notice. Does he ever have any unusual action, or any kind of sound or leer that seems to affect other Pokémon strangely?"</p>

<p>"He likes to launch himself off high places."</p>

<p>"Come again?"</p>

<p>"Local myths say Pengullet once knew how to fly, but they lost the ability, and ever since then they yearn to be airborne," she recounted seriously.</p>

<p>Archer stared at her, then stared at the penguin flapping its wings with a determined look on its face, and then turned back towards Zoe with boredom. "Okay, so Pengullet has three attacks…"</p>

<p>They heard a crashing noise somewhere in the bracken behind them, and Archer turned on his heel immediately. "We couldn't have possibly caught dinner that fast…?"</p>

<p>Zoe, along with their pets Pengullet and Houndoom, followed him to where they'd set the trap and lo and behold, they found not something but some<i>one</i> ensnared in the rope.</p>

<p>It was the wandering merchant.</p>

<p>His ankle had gotten entangled and he was suspended upside down, trying desperately to get free. Scattered on the ground were his hat and some other possessions he'd been carrying. The instant he saw Archer and Zoe standing there, desperation morphed into something bordering on embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Hello again…I'm sorry to mess up your trap like this. I didn't see it there."</p>

<p><i>If you had, I would wonder why you stepped in it,</i> Archer thought with disdain.</p>

<p>"If you could cut me down, I'd be grateful."</p>

<p>Archer was about to do just that when Houndoom's rough bark drew his attention away. The Pokémon was pawing at a piece of tawny paper in the ground, one of the dropped items, and when Archer picked it up with curiosity the merchant's amiable demeanor instantly grew serious.</p>

<p>It was a wanted poster with an artist's rendering depicting both Archer and Zoe, calling for their capture and promising a reward of gold. Vindicated in his earlier suspicions, Archer turned back towards the merchant now fidgeting in the trap.</p>

<p>"I'm sure gratitude comes cheap. So which is it then…are you a wandering merchant or a bounty hunter?" confronted Archer.</p>

<p>"Try both," he retorted.</p>

<p>"Marcus must be getting desperate if he's willing to recruit mercenaries to hunt us down."</p>

<p>"Look, I'm way more involved with them than some average fortune-seeker," the man declared.</p>

<p>"You think your claim can buy you leverage? I doubt it can buy you time," Archer replied with indifference.</p>

<p>"I know where the colonel has the Unowns."</p>

<p>That was the fastest way to snap Archer to attention. He focused on him with interest, and the man smiled in a complacent show of importance.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you everything provided you let me down from here."</p>

<p>"Bold of you to presume you're in any position to make deals," responded Archer. "…but I'm willing to compromise."</p>

<p>At a motion from Archer, Houndoom aimed a stream of fire below the trap. It flared into a bonfire.</p>

<p>The smugness on the man's face quickly vanished. "Hey, what do you think you're doing?"</p>

<p>"Here's my deal," Archer spoke, his voice pleasant. "You tell me where the Unowns are, and I don't let you burn alive."</p>

<p>"If you let me roast here, you'll never find out what I know."</p>

<p>"Then if you really <i>do</i> know something, you'd better talk fast," replied Archer menacingly.</p>

<p>He kept shifting his attention from Archer to Zoe and to the hungry fire below. The rising smoke made him cough.</p>

<p>"He's got them in the Pal Essence Condenser," the man relented. "It draws energy from whatever Pals are locked inside. Alas, the Pals inside are incinerated in the process."</p>

<p>"They're going to <i>incinerate</i> them?" Zoe exclaimed. "The Unown did nothing to harm anyone!"</p>

<p>Archer was also outraged, for a slightly different reason. "That fucking asshole, those critters are supposed to be my ticket home!"</p>

<p>"Marcus considers their loss a noble sacrifice towards a lofty goal," their captive now sneered, rubbing it in. "He thinks he can power up some sort of an ultimate weapon that way. Besides, he didn't like that they came here and started talking with the islanders, writing messages about an outside world...that's why he specifically captured the vowels, so they wouldn't be able to form words."</p>

<p>The flames rose a little higher, and he began wriggling nervously. He glanced hopefully towards Archer, who far from displaying any sympathy was beginning to look irritated.</p>

<p>"You say he's got them in this Pal Condenser whatchamacallit," Archer said. "You still haven't told me <i>where that is</i>."</p>

<p>"It's in the tower."</p>

<p>"Congratulations – that's a big help. There's no way in the damn tower."</p>

<p>"I have a key!" he cried, and without waiting to be asked he tossed Archer a gold key from the inside of his coat.</p>

<p>On a motion from Zoe, Pengullet doused the fire. Archer studied the key; it was a large, antiquated style that certainly looked like it could fit the lock of the tower's main door. Yet he still didn't trust it; the whole thing appeared incredibly easy.</p>

<p>"How do we know it's not a trap?" he asked, glancing up to their captive.</p>

<p>"I want to live," said the man simply. "Please let me down from here."</p>

<p>At a nod from Archer, Zoe turned to Tanzee, which released a flurry of sharp leaves that sliced through the rope. Once freed from the trap, however, the man found himself placed at gunpoint.</p>

<p>"Walk," Archer ordered tersely, as he motioned with the gun.</p>

<p>His prisoner stepped ahead of him obediently, but he asked, "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>Archer was brutally honest. "I can't let you leave."</p>

<p>In a swift action, the man swung about. His fist collided with Archer's chin, and he would have knocked the gun out of his hands had Archer not held tightly. He struggled with Archer to steal the gun to no avail and in the midst of the fight crashed backwards into the fenced-off area where their little flock of chickens were pecking at the ground.</p>

<p>Without warning, the Chikipi squawked and rushed at the unknown man. Several of them pulled back as if charging energy, and before Archer had quite realized what they were doing there was a brilliant flash of harsh light and terrible, earsplitting screeches as multiple attacks were fired at once. When Archer opened his eyes his enemy was gone and there were only ashes remaining.</p>

<p>He stood and looked over at the Chikipi, which were now hopping around with indifference. A few of them were preening their feathers, looking completely innocuous.</p>

<p>"When was someone going to tell me the chickens could learn Hyper Beam…?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>There was something to be said even here on this island, it seemed, for those who treated supposedly inadequate creatures well; it reminded Archer of the fish Pokémon Magikarp, one of the weakest species back home, which with diligent training could evolve into a powerful Gyarados. He glanced at the spot where his opponent had been engulfed by the energy attack.</p>

<p>"Too bad we don't have a rose around here."</p>

<p>"A rose?"</p>

<p>"It's kind of a tradition."</p>

<p>Zoe thought for a moment and stepped away. She returned some moments later with a hibiscus she had plucked from a nearby bush. "Will this work?"</p>

<p>Archer looked at the tropical flower, shrugged his shoulders and took the flower without a word, tossing it to the cinders.</p><h2>Chapter 12 - Fight for the Tower ✅</h2>

<p>The strange tower with its imposing Unown letter I loomed before them, as ominous as it was impressive. Even more so, now that Archer knew what he sought was in there.</p>

<p>From the bracken where they hid, they could see some lights were on inside the building, something which Archer took note of.</p>

<p>"Zoe, to get inside this tower we've got to steer clear of whomever is in there." Archer was clutching the machine gun as he pointed to a side of the tower, "You see the lights in the window over there?"</p>

<p>"I see it."</p>

<p>"I should go myself," Archer decided, "It's safer if one of us stays out here as a look-out."</p>

<p>"No way; this tower is a mystery that my people have wondered about for a long time. I'm going too."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're not better off staying out here? If they catch us sneaking in, we'll both be in dire straits," Archer answered.</p>

<p>"It's my tower," Zoe replied, taking the key from him. "I'm coming."</p>

<p>Archer gave a brisk nod and turned to Frostallion. "All right, you keep watch out here for when we emerge," he instructed it. "We'll whistle for you to come by."</p>

<p>As the Pegasus cantered off, Zoe questioned, "I don't understand why we'd bring a Pal along only to leave it outside."</p>

<p>"Just in case we get caught, there's at least one of our Pokémon free," explained Archer.</p>

<p>There he was going once again, envisioning the worst-case scenario just on the basis of his own traumas. <i>I'm not going to get trapped and taken prisoner. That'd be as implausible as lightning striking the same spot twice,</i> Archer silently assured himself, trying to push the persistent fear aside as he opened another Poké Ball and sent out Houndoom.</p>

<p>"Come on," he motioned to Zoe, and she followed him and Houndoom directly up to the tower.</p>

<p>Zoe easily unlocked the main door and pushed it open tentatively. It moved on its hinges with ease. "I sort of expected it to be jammed from disuse," she murmured to Archer with astonishment.</p>

<p>"More evidence someone's been using your tower behind your backs," Archer whispered in reply.</p>

<p>The inside of the tower was dimly lit and sparse. As their eyes adjusted to the gloom, they saw a wide area reminiscent of the lobby of an office building, with an old reception desk across as well as an elevator and a stairwell to the side, all made of ebony stone and wrought iron and, despite evident age, in excellent condition and fully functional. The wall behind the desk bore the enigmatic letter I insignia, glowing as brilliantly as the larger one on the façade outside.</p>

<p>They stepped in gingerly so as to not let their footsteps sound on the tile floor. Archer had fully expected to find guards stationed directly inside the entrance, but to his surprise there were none; everything here was completely still.</p>

<p>"Let's go up the stairs," Archer said grabbing Zoe by the arm, "We still don't know if there is anyone in this building right now and they could be monitoring the elevator."</p>

<p>Zoe did not argue the point. They climbed many steps up, searching for entry onto any of the upper floors, till they reached one that was unlocked.</p>

<p>Not far from the stairwell, they encountered a door with the gilded initials 'A.R.' marked across it.</p>

<p>They went in and found an office that looked as if it was stuck in a time warp. An old fashioned desk and armchair were situated near a window shuttered with blinds, while a bookcase with various books had been placed against the wall to the right, and a dead potted plant stood in forlorn vigil off to the side. There was dust all over the floor and it was evident no one had been in there for many years.</p>

<p>Countless papers were strewn all over the floor and on top of the desk. While Archer looked at the titles of the books on the shelves, Zoe scrutinized the documents that lay on the desk. "Look at this," she suddenly said.</p>

<p>Archer glanced at her. "They look like deeds to land and real estate."</p>

<p>Zoe meanwhile had taken an envelope in her hands and opened it, taking pains not to tear the letter inside as she pulled it out. The parchment was very old and yellowed, and upon it was handwritten in Unown lettering:</p>

<p>
  <i>'To Whom It May Concern,</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>I was and am the owner of the Island Power and Mining Syndicate, which entered into a business partnership with the Silph Company of Kanto in the spring of last year.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>I feel partly responsible for what has occurred to our region. My business with Silph Co. was in the Poké Ball industry. Silph sent apricorn hulls to serve as Poké Ball casings. We handled the mining of tumblestone and the manual labor required to manufacture the spheres according to Silph's specifications. Silph in turn, handled marketing and sale of the finished product across the mainland. We have always split the profits.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Mr. Silph has wanted for many months to buy out our interests in the land here, but I have refused to sell. The amount he offered for the property was not a fair exchange. Since tumblestone is far more abundant on the island than it is on the mainland, he wanted to appropriate the land and take the entire profit of Poké Ball sales for himself.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>The island has been under a period of political unrest since the establishment of the planetary council. Leading the call for separation was Mr. Dryden, who claimed he could better manage the region under his rule.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Unable to convince us to sell, Silph financed a <i>coup d'état</i> and gave Dryden's army all the backing they needed to take over the island. In return for his assistance, Silph Co. receives tumblestone from the territory they seize at no cost. We have tried to appeal to the planetary council, but they do not wish to expend resources to save such a small region.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Our world was destroyed in the short time Dryden has been in power. They have appropriated all commercial ventures and private property, outlawed the Pokémon League competition to prevent any excuse for unnecessary travel, and forbidden access to the outside world. They have shut electric power to settlements across the entire island and I doubt they will return it any time soon. Those who try to oppose the new regime are publicly executed or taken into servitude, never to be seen again. It is also forbidden to speak of the regions beyond the sea.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>My associates have all fled by now. My cousin is handling our properties in Kalos. He and many others have urged me to escape into exile, but I refuse to leave the island, or everything it means to us. Those closest to me feel the same. If opposing the dictatorship as an absolution means death then we will meet that fate here, fighting to retake our stolen property, starting with our business headquarters – the iconic tower that bears our company logo still.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Until that day, the entire syndicate will remain here protecting the tower, as well as the Pokémon by our side – our beloved pals.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <i>…Mr. Alexander Rayne.'</i>
</p>

<p>Zoe stared at the letter mutely for a long moment.</p>

<p>Archer looked over her shoulder, read it quickly and commented, "That's an interesting story and would actually explain a lot of things. Isn't Rayne your last name also?"</p>

<p>Zoe remained silent and Archer noticed it. "Zoe. Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"That name. Alexander Rayne. I remember my father telling me one day that his grandfather's name was Alexander Rayne. This man was my great-grandfather."</p>

<p>"So, then Marcus is descended from the guy who took over this island and established a dictatorship," reasoned Archer, "Somehow it's all starting to make sense."</p>

<p>Loud steps made Archer jerk his head upward, and he pulled Zoe to the floor. They ducked behind the desk right as two or three PIDF soldiers walked by, and remained hidden till the patrol receded into the shadows. Zoe was still clutching the letter, and when the guards had gone she folded it and stuffed it into her jacket pocket.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Archer with insistence, "Let's see what else there is in this place."</p>

<p>They proceeded down the hall, keeping their pace quick but soundless. Soon they came to another room; whereas all the offices they'd passed previously had been in disarray and abandoned, this one – despite being presently unmanned – was seemingly in current use. It looked like a makeshift cross between a laboratory and a security office, with the prestige of both and the certainty of neither. Bright electric lights illuminated the entire area from above, and several monitors on the wall displayed advanced charts and numerical figures Archer wasn't quite sure how to read, but they appeared to be measuring energy levels.</p>

<p>He immediately focused his attention on something else: the glass chamber he had first seen in the photograph in Marcus' office, within which were the trapped vowel Unowns.</p>

<p>A couple of the little animals squeaked at him from their prison, which was such a tight fit for them they barely had space to move. It was a tall glass chamber, in front of which was a panel with an analog meter of some kind and several buttons, one of which was a large black one, as well as an indicator light that shone a mild blue.</p>

<p>Archer hurried to the contrivance, scowling at all the buttons. <i>I'm not going to risk pressing one of these and accidentally activating the device and incinerating them,</i> he thought, wincing at the mere idea.</p>

<p>He tried striking at the glass with the stock of the gun, but when it didn't open he turned towards his Pokémon.</p>

<p>"Blast it with fire," he told Houndoom, jerking his head towards the glass.</p>

<p>Houndoom gave an acknowledging bark and unleashed a torrent of flame that lashed against the container. The glass did not appear to react in any way.</p>

<p>Archer frowned. "Why doesn't it work...?" He then noticed the tumblestone edge of the top and bottom of the container. "It must be using the same kind of energy barrier as a Poké Ball," he realized, "No wonder the Unowns can't teleport out and free themselves."</p>

<p>One of the Unown gave another sad squeak.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'm getting you out of there," he assured them.</p>

<p>"Look what I found over on the table," he heard Zoe remark from behind him.</p>

<p>Archer was tugging at the device in an attempt to force it open with brute strength when Zoe came over with a little booklet in hand. She pointed adamantly at the pages, and when he glanced over he saw a sketched diagram of the Condenser with several bulleted lines written in Unown lettering.</p>

<p>"I can't believe they actually wrote an instruction booklet for this shit." Without wasting any more time, he pressed a sequence of buttons on the panel; the glass door flung open, and then all the Unowns floated out en masse.</p>

<p>"All right guys, you're free. Thank God," added Archer, relieved, "now I can get off this fucking island."</p>

<p>The Unowns happily squeaked in a grateful chorus. They twirled about him in a circle, and in a brilliant flash of light...the little creatures teleported away, leaving an astonished Archer standing right where he was next to Zoe.</p>

<p>"What? ...No! Come back! You forgot to take me with you!" Archer exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken, footsteps began hurrying down the hall towards them. <i>Fuck.</i></p>

<p>"Someone's coming!" whispered Zoe. Archer had already spun around searching for an alternate way out. He spied his Houndoom pawing at a semi-concealed doorway beside the monitors, and without thinking twice he pulled Zoe aside and they hurried through it.</p>

<p>They emerged to a wide area, with a high ceiling held up by columns, and smooth stone flooring. A circular marking had long ago been etched in glowing light on the ground, as if this place had once been a particularly elegant Pokémon battlefield perhaps reserved for special event matches. On the farthest side of the stadium was a raised accent wall bearing the iconic letter I logo, and directly below this Archer caught a glimpse of motion.</p>

<p>It was Marcus, accompanied by an entourage of at least ten PIDF infantrymen.</p>

<p>"How did you get in here?" His voice thundered in the openness of the space.</p>

<p>"Through the front door," replied Archer, unfazed.</p>

<p>"So you think you're smart? If you take this for a joke, I'm not laughing," said Marcus, walking forward. "First escaping town with Frostallion...then running away with our supply drop...now getting into the tower... I've grossly underestimated you, Mr. Verdi."</p>

<p>"The one who doesn't belong in this place is you," Zoe spoke in a challenge, "This is the Syndicate's tower; it belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, the tower was yours," Marcus answered her, "Just like Grizzbolt."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened at the name of her lost pet. But Marcus wasn't done, and he twisted the knife:</p>

<p>"...<i>was</i>, till I used it as fodder in the Pal Condenser."</p>

<p>"You killed her?"</p>

<p>"It's more accurate to say... distilled down to its essence."</p>

<p>Zoe took a step forward but Archer held her back. He could see the soldiers standing behind Marcus at the ready, guns trailed, waiting for an order to shoot. Marcus surprisingly lifted a hand, causing them to stand at ease.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't even remember when my men lured your Grizzbolt off the campsite and took it," Marcus went on. "We've been very diligent in drugging the grain we provide your Syndicate in return for the wild Pals you catch and supply us. I get Pals without having to expend resources on hunting, you get accused of poaching the wildlife, and I'm seen as the benevolent ruler protecting honest islanders from the barbarians outside the town gates. It's a grand scheme."</p>

<p>"Then all those Pals we hunted..." Zoe's voice trailed.</p>

<p>"...went into the Condenser, as power-ups," Marcus answered her unspoken question, "except for those strong enough to be useful elsewhere. My Faleris doesn't eat Pal meat, you see. Not while we have dissidents to serve as its main course."</p>

<p>He'd produced a sphere from his coat, and threw it up into the air. Faleris appeared in a flash, and Marcus jumped onto the hawk's back, a look of sheer delight and cruelty as he gazed down at Archer and Zoe.</p>

<p>"Faleris – get your dinner."</p>

<p>The giant hawk let out a fearsome cry and flames burst from its wings, morphing into tornadoes of fire. Archer stumbled back narrowly sidestepping the blaze as it roared towards him. The Fire Spin struck against the pillar.</p>

<p>He could hear Marcus laughing. Targeting the sound, Archer pulled out from behind the pillar firing his gun through the wall of fire.</p>

<p>As the combustion flickered away he saw the bullets ricochet off an energy shield protecting Marcus and Faleris, and as he lowered the gun Houndoom bolted ahead right as Faleris shot another fire attack from its open beak directly at Archer. Houndoom met its stream of fire with its own, the two moves colliding in an explosive ball of flame; Faleris' attack was more powerful, and Houndoom yelped as it was forced to spring aside. Smoke trailed in the aftermath of both attacks, carrying with it the ominous spectre of charred scent.</p>

<p>Zoe meanwhile had sent out Tanzee, which let loose a flurry of sharp leaves towards Faleris. They missed utterly.</p>

<p>Archer could see Zoe clench her fists in frustration as Tanzee started hopping around playfully, as if it viewed the whole fight as a game.</p>

<p>Enwreathed in fire, Faleris flew past Tanzee in a gale, aiming again at Archer and Zoe. They could only save themselves by jumping for cover; meanwhile Houndoom lunged at the opportunity, sinking its teeth into one of Faleris' wings. The hawk let out a shriek and Houndoom leapt away before Marcus could club it back.</p>

<p>Faleris vaulted about before slashing at Houndoom. It struck its target across the flank, knocking Houndoom out, and before Faleris could inflict the final blow Archer recalled his pet.</p>

<p>At a signal from its rider, Faleris screeched and swooped down in another fiery tackle, talons outstretched. Archer pulled Zoe to the side and the giant hawk struck against one of the pillars instead, where its claws got jammed into the stone. Squawking, it flapped its wings frantically as Marcus tumbled off its back.</p>

<p>He pulled out Faleris' sphere and recalled it from where it was trapped, only to find himself staring directly into the barrel of Archer's gun.</p>

<p>For the first time since Archer had met this man, he saw fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>Archer smiled maliciously, but the instant he pulled the trigger, vines wrapped around his arm and yanked his hand up. The bullet hit against the ceiling.</p>

<p>He turned his head in time to see Zoe exclaiming in shock, and suddenly he and Zoe were completely entangled in thorny tendrils. It was Tanzee that had unleashed its vine whip.</p>

<p>Zoe let out an astonished cry, "Tanzee, what are you doing?!"</p>

<p>Tanzee was chattering with laughter, its teeth bared in a wide grin.</p>

<p>They were now surrounded by PIDF soldiers. Marcus chuckled as he pulled himself up from where he'd fallen; he took the gun away from Archer, then swung back rapidly. Archer bent over in pain as he was pistol-whipped in the ribs.</p>

<p>"That's for thinking you could depose me." Marcus then glanced at the soldiers, and gave a single order.</p>

<p>"Put them with the others."</p><h2>Chapter 13 - The Prisoners ✅</h2>

<p>Held at gunpoint by PIDF soldiers, a somber Archer and Zoe were escorted down the way as prisoners.</p>

<p>"Fucking Unowns," grumbled Archer.</p>

<p>"Maybe it was an oversight and they'll return?" Zoe considered, trying to boost optimism.</p>

<p>"<i>Unowns</i>? Not a chance in hell."</p>

<p>Tanzee's cackling drew his attention to the grass type, which was jeering at them from the shoulders of one of the guards. "Actually, I take it back," Archer added. "At least you know Unowns are out to cause trouble. The traitor monkey is worse."</p>

<p>"Shut it," snapped the soldier, poking Archer roughly with the muzzle of the rifle he held. Archer bit back some unpleasant answer and fixed his eyes straight ahead as they walked.</p>

<p>They reached a holding area and were pushed unceremoniously into a barred jail cell containing three other people. The soldiers locked the door and then left, with Tanzee remaining atop a table with its leering grin.</p>

<p>The first person Archer noticed was a dark-clad figure sitting wearily to the side, half-leaning against the wall. He was of a fair complexion, with a black visor resting atop tousled salt-and-pepper hair and eyes a shade of magenta; the man was thin enough to imply he hadn't eaten well in more than a few days, though the way he rested his head on one hand was in a manner less evocative of exhaustion and more of boredom.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, out of the group of three other prisoners there, he seemed to be the most curious about them. To the other side was a younger man, his blue hair in cornrows, and wearing loose yellow attire, less interested in the newcomers and more in attempting a futile struggle to reach a key tauntingly out of reach.</p>

<p>The final person was a lady of about twenty, with light green hair cut to a bob, who looked perhaps the most jaded of all her cellmates. She wore a flowing green dress, in a style distinctively of the island.</p>

<p>It was the first of these three people who spoke. "My name is Professor Victor Ashford. I was the head of the Pal Genetic Research Unit." He observed them for a moment and then asked, "Are you Archer and Zoe?"</p>

<p>"You've heard of us?" remarked Archer.</p>

<p>"I heard Colonel Dryden complaining about the two of you."</p>

<p>"I didn't know we were so popular," Archer replied tongue-in-cheek.</p>

<p>Victor gave a disdainful half-scoff. "When the colonel falls afoul of something or someone, he makes sure everybody knows." He turned towards the others and named them in turn, "Might I introduce Axel Travers and Lily Everhart."</p>

<p>"Hey," greeted Axel; the younger man was still trying to get the key from beyond the bars, while the woman Lily, didn't even acknowledge them.</p>

<p>"We formerly headed different government agencies here on Palpagos Island," Victor continued explaining. "The PIDF commissioners were our supervisors."</p>

<p>Faint memories resurfaced of scorched ground seen when they'd first arrived in town and met Marcus. Archer narrowed his eyes. "Oh yes, I heard they decided to downsize."</p>

<p>"When the Unown arrived," —and here Victor glared with accusation towards the younger man in their group— "Axel decided to take it upon himself to leave messages everywhere to spread what they'd said. Colonel Dryden wasn't sure who was responsible, so he eliminated the whole commission and imprisoned their second-in-commands… us."</p>

<p>"You're the one who left that message about the tower and trees?" Archer asked, interested, as he turned towards Axel.</p>

<p>"Sure was," grinned Axel. "I knew there was something going on here because the Unown said so; if I'd understood exactly what, I would have been more blatant. Wasn't it clever, plastering that cryptic shit everywhere to make folks ask questions about this place?"</p>

<p>Victor spoke with poorly disguised resentment. "The Colonel didn't like it very much."</p>

<p>"The Colonel can go to hell."</p>

<p>"It's because of you we're in this prison!" snarled Victor. "If you hadn't woken up one day and decided to become a dissident, we would still be able to come and go as we pleased. You didn't even try to hide that it was you leaving those messages. You made it seem as if there was a conspiracy brewing against the PIDF."</p>

<p>The lady now spoke up. "Can you please, for once, give the fighting a rest? It's bad enough just being here without having to listen to you two always bickering."</p>

<p>"Finally found something worse than griping about how Marcus is mistreating the Pals, Lily?" retorted Axel.</p>

<p>"No, but if anything all this is a testament to how incorrigible human cruelty is. The colonel claimed the PIDF was protecting the wildlife here, but all he was doing was profiting off them in secret...and you don't give a damn. And you…" Lily now levied her scathing criticism against Victor, "had to go and make the Pal Essence Condenser, thinking that would appease Marcus. The first thing he does is feed <i>our own Pals</i> into the ether. Of course you didn't have any Pals of your own, so what did you care."</p>

<p>Zoe broke in, addressing Victor. "You invented it? Why would you invent something like that?"</p>

<p>"To see if it would work." Victor looked as bored and nonchalant as ever.</p>

<p>"I suppose you regret it now," Lily prompted.</p>

<p>He thought about it for a moment. "...no. It was a good experiment."</p>

<p>Archer had the distinct idea Lily would have liked to hurl something at Victor, just out of spite.</p>

<p>"The only reason the Unowns weren't immediately done away with is that they somehow jammed the device with their psychic energy. It's anyone's guess why the Colonel is keeping us alive," Victor continued, turning back to Archer and Zoe. "Colonel Dryden is very open about what he dislikes, not necessarily what he plans to do about it. …You know the Unowns weren't even the initial plan? He'd sent his men out before to catch a Frostallion, up in the Astral Mountains, and wanted me to attempt crossing its DNA with that of his Faleris to see if an even stronger Pal could be produced. I heard they successfully caught one, only to turn around and have it run off."</p>

<p>"That must be the Frostallion we stole," deduced Zoe, with a glance towards Archer.</p>

<p>"You stole it? From the <i>PIDF</i>?" Victor sounded truly impressed. "No wonder the Colonel is so angry at you."</p>

<p>"Look," Archer said, "ever since I landed here, Marcus Dryden seems as determined to prevent the islanders from knowing about the mainland regions, as he is to keep the mainland regions from knowing about this island. I know he's the ruling dictator or what-not here, but there's something more that he's up to and for all the shit I've been put through I feel I ought to know. This Pal Condenser thing, for starters. What's he trying to siphon energy from Pokémon for, anyway?"</p>

<p>"His ultimate weapon," Victor replied, as if that answered the question.</p>

<p>Footsteps preceded an arrival, and they all glanced up to see none other than Colonel Marcus Dryden enter with a contingent of four or five of his soldiers. Tanzee immediately scampered over to him.</p>

<p>"Good work Tanzee," Marcus said to it, "I'll make sure you get back home to your tamer."</p>

<p>He held a Poké Ball – a modern one, in its shiny red-and-white finish – and opened it to call Tanzee in. He then turned to Archer, entirely disregarding Zoe.</p>

<p>He was beaming at his own triumph. Archer wanted to beat the smugness off his face.</p>

<p>"I presume you've been making yourself comfortable here with my other guests," Marcus began, "Faleris is still recuperating its strength in its Pal Sphere in the other room because of you. As a result you've left me without a ride home, at least till my soldiers get another mount here."</p>

<p>He'd retrieved another Poké Ball from his coat pocket. This one was one of the antique Pal Spheres, which considering Faleris was recovering elsewhere, Archer figured must be empty.</p>

<p>"It's not a loss. I have plenty to entertain myself with here," said Marcus, the hint of a threat playing in his tone.</p>

<p>Archer tried to stop himself from watching the Pal Sphere that Marcus held too closely. He tried to force away growing feelings of fear; he couldn't shake off the worry that he'd soon have to relive a nightmare. <i>You're letting your traumas run wild. You might be a prisoner, but Zoe said it was seen as inhumane here, just as it's supposed to be on the mainland. Not everyone even thinks about doing such a thing. ...They're not going to trap you in one of those.</i></p>

<p>Marcus noticed Archer's unease, and Archer glanced away. Without saying anything, he tucked the Pal Sphere in his coat pocket and regarded his prisoner steadily for a moment.</p>

<p>"Where are the Unowns?" Marcus demanded.</p>

<p>"Halfway across the globe," Archer replied, not missing a beat.</p>

<p>"They think they're safe now, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You expect to chase them?"</p>

<p>He'd spoken flippantly, as if it were a joke. It took a double-take for him to realize that Marcus was, in fact, genuinely serious.</p>

<p>"I'll grant you an explanation," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"You mean a monologue," Archer replied.</p>

<p>Marcus ignored his comment and spoke, "On this island we can mine gold and paldium – what you of the mainland call tumblestone – to excess. By blending gold and paldium and adding crude oil, we can produce a material we call plasteel."</p>

<p>Archer was unimpressed. "You just ripped that name off from a science fiction story. I'm pretty sure I heard it before."</p>

<p>Marcus continued. "I have an entire factory working to produce plasteel. It makes it possible to produce weaponry and armor beyond even what the modern world knows of, and to create Pal Spheres capable of capturing any creature without fail."</p>

<p>"...do you mean Master Balls?" Archer remarked, now realizing with interest they'd somehow attained the missing ingredient to a formula Giovanni had sought for some time.</p>

<p>"All that's left to acquire are weaponry blueprints my associate is sending us from outside," Marcus continued. "With that kind of technology, and with Faleris as the strongest Pal the island has ever seen, the PIDF will be an unstoppable force. We'll be able to conquer the world beyond the sea!"</p>

<p>Of all his captives, all remained speechless – all, that is, except for Archer, who began laughing loudly.</p>

<p>Marcus regarded him with disdain. "I fail to see what's so amusing, Mr. Verdi."</p>

<p>"The banana republic dictator thinks he can take over the planet," snickered Archer. "...and why? Because you've had success with your little Pal-world? The Pokémon world is far bigger than your tiny island, with more power than you can ever imagine. It's pointless how many laser cannons or overcharged gatling guns your third-world sweatshop can produce; your army is outnumbered <i>a hundred</i>-to-one."</p>

<p>"I have an ally on the mainland who says it can be done," replied Marcus undaunted.</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn if your ally is on the fucking planetary council," Archer told him seriously, "They're lying to you."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to bluff? Because you're not in a position to. This is my island," emphasized Marcus, "No one who lands on this island ever leaves. Palpagos Island doesn't even exist to the rest of the world without my say-so; it's only on the map when I say it is."</p>

<p>Archer became somber suddenly, and said, "This island is a stolen paradise, and everything the civilized world could want. That's just it – you're fighting a losing battle." He hesitated here. "You have no idea who's behind me. You obviously have no idea who you're dealing with."</p>

<p>"I'm sure the Rayne Syndicate once believed that. And look what they've turned into, thanks to several years of drugged food and living in the jungle outside of town like wild Pals. They're as blind as the islanders," Marcus laughed scornfully. "For all I care, they can all live their little sad lives without ever knowing the extent of what's really going on. Besides, if I let garbage like them get carried away learning too much, they'll just go off demanding rights."</p>

<p>"Like the truth behind this tower? Beyond its history; the secret it holds. The tower is the key, right?" Archer said. "You already control Palpagos Island. You don't need the mainland. What is it you really want?"</p>

<p>"Accomplishment. My grandfather established this regime. My father cemented it. I will be the one to expand it. And I won't let anyone undo the work of a hundred years in a day." Marcus seized Archer by the lapel. "You will never, in a thousand <i>centuries</i>, learn the secret of this tower."</p>

<p>"I already know," Archer retorted. "You told me when you said you're keeping the island off the map. The tower's the tallest thing for miles, so you put the antenna for a cloaking device on the roof."</p>

<p>They faced off steadily for a few moments and then Marcus addressed the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Take him...and her."</p>

<p>They opened the jail door, and two guards hauled Archer and Zoe out at gunpoint as Marcus led the way from the room.</p><h2>Chapter 14 - Mirage Island ✅</h2>

<p>Miles from any known region, a ship sailed on the sea towards coordinates as of yet unknown. It was manned by Pokémon trainers in distinctive black uniforms with a bright red R, and coiled whips and Poké Balls on their belts, the unmistakable attire of Team Rocket grunts; at the ship's helm were elite agents James and Jessie, dressed in their high-rank white uniforms with equal armament as their subordinates.</p>

<p>"Remember when we were on submarine duty?" James, ever the sentimentalist, reminisced, "the three of us crammed in that Magikarp-shaped vessel?"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you're nostalgic for that tin can," Jessie laughed good-naturedly, "at least here we can see where we're going without a damn periscope."</p>

<p>Beside them on the deck, Meowth was lashing his tail. "So lemme get this straight," the cat said, redirecting their conversation, "they got this island we're sailing to on record as a wildlife sanctuary?"</p>

<p>"Because supposedly the Pokémon here branched out separately from the rest of the world," affirmed Jessie, "so you can find species here which just don't thrive elsewhere."</p>

<p>Meowth narrowed his eyes. "Except they didn't tell anyone there were humans living on the island too? ...and it mysteriously vanished off the map many years back?"</p>

<p>James gave a brisk nod. "It wouldn't have been very flattering to admit that in this modern day and age, the planetary council didn't defend one of their smaller regions from takeover."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," added Jessie, "the people there are apparently still living like a third-world nation fighting over food and water, or at least they <i>were</i> those many years back."</p>

<p>"But I don't get it?" meowed the cat, "Doesn't the council do anything to oversee the place at all? What about the Pokémon League...didn't they have a division here?"</p>

<p>"Supposedly they've been letting them govern themselves all this time; no one's cared to check up on them. And the Pokémon League could easily be paid off in grants for its losses. Anyway, the island belongs to the boss now," Jessie said.</p>

<p>Wind buffeted the deck of the ship with its salty sea-spray, and the closer they got to the coordinates, the more seagull Pokémon they saw flying around and diving for prey in the water. Not a single sliver of land appeared on the horizon however.</p>

<p>James stood on the starboard side of the ship, gazing out at the sea. "Jess, I think we might've been sent on a wild Chansey chase. I don't see anything over there."</p>

<p>Meowth leapt onto James' head, the cat's ears and whiskers alert towards the ocean. "You sure about that? There's some kinda energy barrier rippling about the water."</p>

<p>"I don't see any force field."</p>

<p>"You humans don't see things right in front of you," meowed the cat.</p>

<p>Jessie came over to James' side and lifted binoculars towards where Meowth was now pawing the air.</p>

<p>"Meowth…" said Jessie, gazing intently through the lens.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>She lowered her binoculars. "There's nothing there."</p>

<p>The cat hissed.</p>

<p>Lifting the binoculars again, Jessie continued to search the ocean with a scowl. "We've been sailing around this damn area for hours already. If we can't spot that island soon, we might have to head back and let the boss know he paid money for a mirage."</p><hr>

<p>Archer and Zoe walked in silence with their escort of guards as Marcus strode ahead down the corridor. Deep inside, Archer's unease was growing; he could only surmise what their captors had in store for them.</p>

<p>They were led back to the brightly lit room with the Pal Condenser. Marcus halted here and turned to face them both.</p>

<p>Maybe another explanation. A...demonstration? This <i>was</i> just like that time back in the Orre region; the courtesy before some agony would be inflicted upon them. His mind was already painting elaborate nightmares from a palette of deductions, and he forced himself to stay calm.</p>

<p><i>No, but it's not the same,</i> Archer assured himself, though his heart was beginning to hasten its pace, <i>they're not going to do the same thing. There's no way they'd do that...</i></p>

<p>The slightest shudder ran through him.</p>

<p>He felt Zoe briefly press against his side, a comforting presence that brought him back to the moment.</p>

<p>"You impressed me with the battle against Faleris," Marcus was saying. "No one has ever been able to defeat us before. So I'll grant you a favor. I'll let one of you live."</p>

<p>Marcus turned around as a Katress padded into the room; it was a bicolor, light-blue and black feline, reminiscent of an Espeon though it stood on its hind legs, with a tuft of purple fur on its head that looked somewhat comically like a witches' pointed hat. In its paws it carried a cup filled with some kind of dark liquid, which Marcus took from the cat and placed before Archer and Zoe.</p>

<p>"This is made of nightshade," said Marcus, "...what we here on the island call 'Bellanoir's eclipse' after the legendary dark type. It'll kill whomever drinks it within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"You can't be serious?" Zoe echoed.</p>

<p>"Hell no," Archer countered. "If you expect to intimidate us into committing suicide, you can forget it."</p>

<p>"If you don't decide, then you will both die." As he spoke, he pointed a gun first at Archer, then turned slowly and aimed directly at Zoe. "In that case I can assure you, taking poison is more merciful."</p>

<p>Both Archer and Zoe gazed at him dumbfounded. Marcus lowered the gun.</p>

<p>"Make your choice," he said.</p>

<p>When they glanced uneasily at the poison and then at each other, yet neither made a move, Marcus advanced towards Zoe. She backed away from him but the soldiers seized her on both sides roughly, leading to her struggling in desperation. Marcus grabbed her by the chin and she tried unsuccessfully to kick him only to get slapped hard across the cheek, and she gasped in pain.</p>

<p>Archer didn't wait to see how it would play out, nor did he attempt to call their bluff. He reached over to take the nightshade drink from where it was and, willingly, he closed his eyes and swallowed it all.</p>

<p>It was sweet, but gave way to a subtle bitterness that lingered on the tongue. He placed the cup on the table, and looked up towards Marcus. "All right, satisfied? You have your sacrifice. Now let her go."</p>

<p>"You never cease to surprise me," Marcus remarked, lifting his eyebrows. "You struck me as mercenary, never as the gallant type."</p>

<p>"Archer..." Zoe started to say, but her voice trailed. Archer just jerked his head slightly for her to leave now, and without saying anything more Zoe turned to be led away.</p>

<p>The moment she did, Marcus reached into his pocket and whirled around – flinging a Pal Sphere at her.</p>

<p>She barely had time to give a startled outcry as the capsule struck her and opened, and she vanished in a flare of light.</p>

<p>Archer saw this, and his own tormented memories mingled all at once with aghast horror. He tried to leap for Marcus but the soldiers halted him with their weapons. "You bastard! You said you'd let her go."</p>

<p>Marcus turned towards Archer, evidently regaling in the torment he was inflicting on him. "Don't try to put words in my mouth. I merely said I'd let her live."</p>

<p>He only stared at him, unable to retort, as the sphere stopped shaking and Marcus picked it up from the floor. At that point, one of the soldiers walked in and saluted.</p>

<p>"Colonel," said the guard, "Your mainland associate has telephoned and is on hold to speak with you."</p>

<p>"Alas, I have business to tend to. It appears this will be the last we see of each other in this life, then... Good luck, Mr. Verdi," said Marcus, with a cordial dip of his head, and exited the room with the Katress following.</p>

<p>The world had seemed to slow for Archer. Everything had been a disaster, and nothing had gone to plan. Then again, why would he have thought it would? He wasn't in Kanto or Johto or Unova, where people took honesty and honor as cornerstones of civilization and one could buy antidotes at the corner mart; he was on a primitive island in the middle of nowhere. And he was going to die.</p>

<p>The worst was the thought he'd somehow been responsible for Zoe's capture. Throwing the sphere had been a deliberate choice by Marcus, because he'd seen Archer's concern over the empty capsule in the holding room. Somehow he'd deduced it was Archer's biggest fear, and of course used that to advantage.</p>

<p>The terrible thing was he should have seen it coming...he should have anticipated it. He was from Team Rocket, an <i>admin</i> of Team Rocket no less; he also knew these techniques from having been in both the position of inquisitor and victim at different times. A person's innermost terrors were always the first thing to be manipulated.</p>

<p>He wouldn't have wished imprisonment like that on anyone, let alone someone who'd become a friend.</p>

<p>In a sudden impulse and rush of vengefulness, he clenched his hand into a fist, spun about and hit the guard next to him.</p>

<p>The guard fell, knocked cold to the floor, as the second soldier reached for a handgun, but Archer acted faster punching him too. The impact knocked him backward into the Pal Condenser's glass container, and without thinking twice Archer slammed the door shut and struck the large button.</p>

<p>A single warning alarm blared out, and a scream drowned in a burst of burning light as the dial on the meter swung sharply right. Archer didn't wait to see the gruesome outcome; he snatched up the dropped handgun from the floor and raced out into the hallway.</p>

<p>The sound had drawn the attention of the guards outside, and even Marcus, who had walked away down the hall, turned back in confusion in time to see Archer burst into view.</p>

<p>Marcus's guards quickly cast forth Pal Spheres, whereupon multiple snarling Direhowl and even a couple of Lamball sprang out to attack. One of the sheep rolled at him in a spinning tackle; Archer jumped aside and fired above the animals, aiming for their trainers. He hit two soldiers one after the other and as they collapsed the rest ducked aside.</p>

<p>Then the worst thing happened at the worst moment. Archer's gun jammed.</p>

<p>As he scrambled to remove and reload the magazine, a Hyper Beam blasted towards him. Archer hit the floor as the screeching energy struck where he'd stood, crackling overhead as it fizzled out against the wall. One of the Direhowl launched itself at Archer, fangs bared, right as the magazine snapped into place and he jerked upward to shoot. The impact of the bullet pushed the wolf back in mid-air and it fell to the floor dead.</p>

<p>He fired again at the soldiers, but this time one of them seized a Lamball they'd sent out and held it in front of him. The little sheep bleated with fear as the gunshot narrowly missed. Archer grimaced.</p>

<p>"Fucking coward, using your low-level Pokémon as a shield," he muttered, shooting at the soldier's leg instead. When the man exclaimed and subsequently dropped the Lamball, Archer quickly shot again and dispatched him.</p>

<p>He'd momentarily gotten his opponents into disarray. Catching sight of Marcus fleeing down the path, his open coat billowing behind him and Zoe's Pal Sphere in hand, Archer pointed the gun at him.</p>

<p>Marcus gave a sharp yell as the bullet grazed the back of his hand and the Pal Sphere flew into the air, colliding against the wall. It burst open in a flare of white light and Zoe emerged, her violet eyes wide with shock.</p>

<p>Instantly Archer was at her side, crushing the sphere that now lay on the floor under his heel. It shattered into pieces, far more fragile than a mainland Poké Ball. "Zoe," he said, holding her, "are you all right?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine," replied Zoe, gazing into his eyes.</p>

<p>The emotion of their reunion was short-lived. They turned to see Marcus standing only steps away, clutching his bleeding hand as fury contorted his features into a scowl.</p>

<p>"Twenty-thousand pieces of gold..." Marcus ordered, seething with fury, "for the man who brings them back <i>dead</i>."</p>

<p>"Run for it!" Archer cried, pushing Zoe down the corridor, when suddenly they were confronted by the Katress.</p>

<p>Hissing, the catlike creature sent out several balls of violet energy, which twirled towards them. They pulled aside evasively; one of the orbs of energy flew past them into the holding room to crash against the prison door, melting the lock. Axel saw his opportunity and immediately pushed it open.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here!" Axel cried out as he ran from the jail cell, with Lily and Victor running close behind.</p>

<p>As they all ran for the doorway Archer noticed a low hanging shelf on the way out of the room; on it were the Poké Balls that were taken from him and Zoe upon captivity. With a swift motion, he grabbed them and stuffed a couple into his pocket, handing Zoe the others.</p>

<p>He glanced back when he heard a scream, and saw Lily fall to the floor, killed by a Hyper Beam in the back. In the same instant, Victor was seized by Tanzee's vines. The grass type monkey, which had apparently been sent out during the fray, cackled fiendishly.</p>

<p>"Go...!" Victor shouted, motioning to Archer, Zoe, and Axel to flee, right as he ripped out of the entanglement. It was futile though; another gunshot pierced through the air, and he collapsed onto the floor dead.</p>

<p>The three of them ran all the way to the rooftop. Here, Archer whistled and Frostallion flew up to meet them. The moment they all saw the horse standing there, however, a new problem was discovered.</p>

<p>"Three people won't all be able to ride on its back," said Archer, voicing their unanimous thoughts, "We'll be too heavy for it."</p>

<p>"Too bad," muttered Axel, and then added forcefully, "It seems our alliance ends here!"</p>

<p>Before Archer could fully react, Axel swung about and struck him in the stomach, and in a single motion leapt astride the horse. The animal reared back with a whinny and jumped into the air.</p>

<p>"You traitor! We helped you escape!" shouted Zoe, as she took the gun out of Archer's hand and lifted it to fire at Axel. Archer quickly outstretched an arm and held her back. Zoe did not protest but looked at him in surprise, asking:</p>

<p>"Are we just going to let him get away with this?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer. They watched as Frostallion got into in full flight, and Axel couldn't resist a parting gloat:</p>

<p>"When you see Faleris at mealtime, tell him I said <i>bon appétit</i>...!"</p>

<p>Archer smiled coldly and pulled out a Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"Frostallion...return," he ordered.</p>

<p>Axel's boastful glee was replaced by a look of sheer horror, and he couldn't utter a single word before his mount was engulfed below him in glistening red light, Frostallion disappearing at the same time as he screamed and plummeted miles down to the doom of solid ground.</p>

<p>Zoe winced, a bit disconcerted as she peered over the edge of the drop. Archer, to the contrary, was jovially callous. "Gravity's a bitch."</p>

<p>"Apparently so," agreed Zoe.</p>

<p>Archer sent out the perplexed Frostallion again; he and Zoe mounted the horse and flew off right as the PIDF soldiers burst onto the rooftop and began shooting at them.</p>

<p>He gazed down at them as the flying horse looped around the building. The effects of the poison concoction were slowly creeping on him; his vision was starting to blur, and his breath was beginning to get labored, but if he was going to die then he'd take a few of his enemies with him – and fuck up Marcus' plans besides. Archer mustered a grin and gripped the reins tight.</p>

<p>"All right Frostallion, show me what a war-horse can do."</p>

<p>Frostallion whinnied and outstretched its wings, coating them in a flash of pointed ice like glacial swords. It swooped down at high speed, past the soldiers, and aimed directly for the antenna.</p>

<p>A giant explosion engulfed the tower rooftop in a shock wave of ice and flame; Marcus, who'd opened the rooftop door, immediately pulled back as his soldiers were flung backwards, some screaming as they fell to their deaths from the height. He could only shout curses as Frostallion whipped past overhead, its wings shimmering with ice and its riders cheering their victory.</p><hr>

<p>Out in the ocean, the Team Rocket ship had given up on locating the island and turned to retreat back to the mainland when they heard an explosion in the distance.</p>

<p>A charge of energy accumulated on the sea and, like a tidal wave, cascaded against an unseen barrier that rippled all at once into visibility. Beyond it, as if hidden by a curtain all this time, lay the most pristine tropical island Jessie, James, and Meowth had ever seen in their many travels. The coastline ringed with shimmering tumblestone boulders shaped into pyramids, palm trees along fine gold sand with a forested mountain peak as backdrop, and most impressive of all a single skyscraper with the Unown letter I on it glowing like a company logo.</p>

<p>Atop the skyscraper was a ball of fire, and circling in mid-air was what looked like an icy Rapidash racing across the wind. The creature, and what looked like two riders astride it, swooped down and vanished beneath the canopy of trees into the secluded safety of the woods.</p>

<p>Looking through her binoculars, Jessie noticed the riders of the flying horse, and recognized Archer. "Turn about!" she cried, as the boat spun backward towards the island.</p>

<p>She joined James and Meowth as they gazed out in astonishment at the beautiful sight before them.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," James marvelled. "Our mirage island actually exists?"</p>

<p>Meowth chimed in with a yowl, "Told ya so! That also means all those different species that're supposed to live there must exist too!"</p>

<p>"Different or not, they're still Pokémon," declared Jessie, with a smile, "and all Pokémon exist for the glory of Team Rocket."</p><h2>Chapter 15 - Poison ✅</h2>

<p>Jett had been on hold for what seemed like an unnecessarily long time, and was about to hang up the telephone when her business associate at last took the call.</p>

<p>She was incredibly peeved. "Marcus."</p>

<p>"Jett," he reciprocated, "apologies I couldn't come to the phone sooner. I was held up over here by an unforeseen situation."</p>

<p>He sounded out of breath. She didn't much care.</p>

<p>"Yes, well, I'm simply calling to let you know that the second supply shipment is on the way, so you'd better make sure you send extra security or whatever you need to get it. The plane will be passing over the island in a few days time."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Marcus, "we'll be sure to get the drop."</p>

<p>"... and after that," Jett continued a bit emphatically, "I expect the payment to be sent."</p>

<p>'<i>Payment</i>', of course, was a mild allegory for what essentially amounted to '<i>flatten a section of Lumiose City for me</i>.'</p>

<p>Marcus, to her chagrin, did not acknowledge the statement in any way. "By the way I have your Pal here, which you sent over to help keep lookout on those Syndicate people," he said instead. "Do you want it back?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think Pansage has had enough of an adventure over there," Jett concurred. "Probably enough to raise his level several times over. I'll come by around the same time as the supply drop does to pick up my Pokémon myself."</p>

<p>The easiest way of training a Pokémon, she'd found, was to drop it on Palpagos Island to help Marcus in whatever chore he had and to get it back after a couple of months. It was far faster than deigning to go out battling herself and much more cost effective than paying one of the local Pokémon daycares or breeding centers to do it for her. Jett imagined her Pansage, or Tanzee as Marcus and the rest of the islanders apparently called its species, would probably be just about the right level by now for her to consider evolving it into a Simisage.</p>

<p>"Your yacht can dock at Fisherman's Point, like you've done in the past. We will speak again soon," Marcus said, and hung up before she could respond.</p>

<p>"You're in an awful hurry, Marcus," Jett muttered as she returned the receiver to its cradle. That said it hardly mattered, so long as he came through with what he promised.</p>

<p>She distrusted him. But as long as <i>he</i> did not distrust her, the gamble would pay off.</p>

<p>At least things had been relatively quiet in the past few days. There had not been any other rogue wild Pokémon attacking anywhere, and she was glad for it. The urban redevelopment project was making good progress and Lumiose City was already seeing more tourism as a result, with trainers flocking to catch some of the rare Pokémon that had begun nesting in the newly built wild zones, and Quasartico Inc. was profiting as well. <i>So far, so good,</i> she thought.</p>

<p>As she let her mind wander, her gaze briefly landed on the flowering plant near the window. Its three pointed petals were open towards the sun and vines reached out of its pot in a beautiful cascade, with fine dew shimmering on the leaves.</p>

<p><i>...actually, that can't be dew,</i> Jett realized. <i>How can it have dew indoors? I guess it's just like that... What a remarkable plant.</i></p>

<p>Jett stayed there all day. By late afternoon the phone rang. It was Corbeau.</p>

<p>"Jett, I've been meaning to ask you...what are these flowers called, again?"</p>

<p>"Eternal Flowers."</p>

<p>"How big do they grow?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know." She glanced reflexively at the flower pot beside the window; she could've sworn the blossom was even larger today than yesterday, and not by a small amount. "I think they're supposed to grow fairly big...?"</p>

<p>She'd already asked the gardener, Seymore, the same question a couple of days ago. He'd been apologetic and admitted that he had no idea. "I've never seen this kind of flower before," Seymore had told her. "The ones outside have shown varying degrees of growth. The vines spread fairly rapidly."</p>

<p>"Well, the plants you gave me have grown enormously," Corbeau replied, snapping her attention back to the present conversation, "so much so that I've had to place them outside of the building, near the entrance... I could swear they moved a few inches from the spot my landscaping team initially planted them."</p>

<p>"I must confess, the same thing happened to the plants I've been dealing with," Jett confided. "My gardener has no explanation."</p>

<p>"You know Jett..." he paused for a moment, then continued, "I'm a practical man, but I'm also a careful man; I think I'll bring in a scientist to take a look at these plants and give me their opinion. I still think they might be poisonous."</p>

<p>"Corbeau, with all due respect, you say that because you are, among other things, a gym leader that deals with poison types."</p>

<p>There was a minute of silence at the other end of the phone line and Jett worried she might have offended him, however, he continued speaking without any change in the inflection of his voice. "Jett, I am going to find a scientist who will do a bit of research on these strange plants. I figure you might want to hear about this, considering I know something similar happened near one of Quasartico's construction sites," he told her, "There was another incident with a wild Pokémon, near my gym. This time it was an Audino."</p>

<p>"Oh no," Jett muttered.</p>

<p>"The good thing is that this Pokémon didn't want to annihilate everyone; it just seemed in distress. It seemed it'd gotten itself tangled in vines."</p>

<p>"In vines?"</p>

<p>"It was a rather peculiar Audino; it had white fur instead of pink, and its ears were standing up straight. One of the gym employees managed to untangle it from the vines, and they tell me it reverted to being a regular Audino right in front of them," Corbeau recounted. "Unfortunately the Pokémon ran off before they could get a better look at it."</p>

<p>"I remember the myths they tell here in the Kalos region about a type of temporary evolution some Pokémon can undergo, called mega evolution," Jett reminisced, "I know no one has ever seen it in real life, but some scientists say it's theoretically possible...perhaps in another dimension. This would be the first I've ever heard of something akin to that actually happening."</p>

<p>She frowned pensively.</p>

<p>"But if that's true, <i>why</i>? Why would all these Pokémon suddenly be mega evolving seemingly by themselves, out of nowhere?"</p>

<p><i>It couldn't be the Eternal Flowers affecting the Pokémon, could it?</i> Jett reflected with annoyance, as she thought back to the previous account of a mega evolved Pokémon. <i>Hadn't that occurred after the flowers were brought in...? Not like that will make a difference of course. These plants are too beautiful to uproot merely because the wildlife doesn't have sense enough to walk around them.</i></p>

<p>"Well, no one saw the strange Audino outside of myself and my gym's employees," Corbeau said. "I am busy, so we'll chat later."</p>

<p>He hung up the phone, as did Jett, and she was left thinking about the possibility of the beautiful blooms being poisonous. <i>If the wild Pokémon are getting tangled in the plants, certainly they wouldn't try to eat them...would they?</i></p>

<p>Jett stared at the flower and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter...If it were really harmful something would've happened by now," she told herself.</p>

<p>Jett sighed, and began sorting through all the paperwork she had on her desk, not paying attention to the plant near the window, which was now using its vines to slide itself slowly away from the sun to a shadier spot on the window.</p><hr>

<p>By the time Archer and Zoe reached the cabin, the sun had already set and evening shadows were darkening the forest. Archer was ill. He could barely focus on what was ahead of him, and with it came a feeling that he might faint or vomit or both. Zoe took Frostallion's reins from him when she saw him lean forward, resting his head on the horse's frosty mane.</p>

<p>She tethered the horse and helped him off the animal. He was partially leaning on her for support as they went into the cabin, and she directed him to the main bed.</p>

<p>Archer lay down shivering. Zoe took a blanket and covered him with it.</p>

<p>"It's probably a long shot..." Archer said, his voice growing faint, "have you ever seen large pink berries, with pointed leaves? We call them Pecha Berries on the mainland... Maybe they're a different color here, or something..."</p>

<p>She gave a small shake of her head. "I've never seen any plant like that here," Zoe replied. "We don't know of any cure for poisoning."</p>

<p>"So if your Pal gets attacked by a poison type, they die?"</p>

<p>"Some of them get immunity."</p>

<p>"I wish I were back home," he answered. He closed his eyes briefly and reopened them to notice Zoe's worried look as she searched his face for any progression of the poison.</p>

<p>He suddenly felt a pang of sympathy for her, after all she was caring for him, and now he had begun worrying about her. <i>What would happen to her if he died? How would she make it back to her people now that Marcus had her on a hunt list?</i> His thoughts were interrupted when she spoke.</p>

<p>"I never got to thank you for what you did back at the tower," said Zoe, "I don't understand how Tanzee could have betrayed us."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to understand," replied Archer, "It sounded like that monkey had a previous trainer... Tanzee was planted there like a spy."</p>

<p>"No wonder Tanzee showed up around the time Grizzbolt disappeared," Zoe considered ruefully.</p>

<p>"Marcus thought up a lot, but he overlooked something..." Archer said weakly, "For all that about wanting to expand his rule with special weapons or plasteel or whatever he's doing....I don't think he even realized the weaponry blueprints he needs were part of what we stole from that supply drop."</p>

<p>They were both quiet for a long moment. He glanced over to the nightstand drawer where they'd hidden the schematics.</p>

<p>"If you ever see people who say they're part of Team Rocket...with a uniform that has a red letter R...give them the blueprints and tell them what happened...please." Archer swallowed with difficulty; his throat was beginning to feel dry. "Maybe it's wishful thinking but I can't help but hope that the Unowns maybe went off to get help, or someone...and then they'd be back... Stupid, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's not stupid," replied Zoe, "They seem to be intelligent creatures."</p>

<p>Archer felt his eyelids getting heavy and could barely keep his eyes open. Zoe put a hand on his forehead and noted, "Your face is warm, hopefully not a fever brewing. I'm getting something to bring down your temperature." She walked away and came back a few minutes later with a cool wet cloth, which she put on his forehead.</p>

<p>"That feels good," he said.</p>

<p>Archer was unaware precisely when he fell asleep, only that it came alongside a whirlpool of confusion. His nightmares were bizarre and fraught with violence, and he tossed and turned in restless sleep. He was far from the island, hauled by memories back into a dark and forbidding room, with a master who inflicted cruelty and compassion on a whim. It was constant interrogation with intermittent agony, till his heart raced and his breath caught short and he was begging once more for reprieve. All he wanted was peace.</p>

<p>"Please...I'll do whatever you ask of me..." he was whispering, "I can't take any more... Stop..."</p>

<p>Delirious from the effects of the poison, Archer tried to reach towards items on the floor next to the bed. Zoe, who had remained by his side, followed his gesture and realized he wanted to get the Poké Balls.</p>

<p>She took Houndoom's Poké Ball and handed it to him, then watched with wonder as he tapped the button on it. The sphere's red lid opened and, with a flash that momentarily illuminated the dark room in glistening white light, sent out Houndoom. The dog pawed at him and whined.</p>

<p>He gazed perplexed at the open capsule, as if his mind was blank with confusion. "Archer, try not to move around so much. You need rest," she advised him.</p>

<p>Archer lifted his eyes groggily towards her; his pupils were dilated so wide they seemed like ink wells. "Where are we?" he murmured. "I barely remember getting here."</p>

<p>"In the cabin. We're safe here."</p>

<p>"You've been taking care of me all this time?"</p>

<p>"You sound surprised. We're friends, that's what friends do."</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was clattering outside, followed by frantic clucking of the Chikipi. This drew Zoe's attention to the window. Houndoom, meanwhile, lay his head beside Archer on the bed as she walked away.</p>

<p>She pulled back the curtains slightly. Everything outside was still. Moonlight shed a feeble glow across the pond, which did not even betray ripples of a nighttime breeze.</p>

<p>With a slight frown, Zoe turned away from the window and returned to Archer's bedside.</p>

<p>"It's strange. I could've sworn there was something out there bothering the Chikipis." She had barely said these words when the door burst open and in came several soldiers clad in black with a red letter R on their uniforms, followed by their captains James and Jessie.</p>

<p>Houndoom barked and wagged his tail.</p>

<p>"Good to see you haven't forgotten us, Houndoom," Jessie said.</p>

<p>"Archer, you look like shit," James observed. "I thought vacationing on a tropical island would do you some good."</p>

<p>God, he was happy to see his colleagues again. Weak as he still was, he managed a smirk.</p>

<p>"What took you guys so long…?"</p>

<p>"The Unowns found us on the beach and pointed us in the right direction," said James.</p>

<p>Meowth came in at that moment, took one look at Archer and said, "Damn. Who messed you up so bad?"</p>

<p>Zoe glanced at Meowth in surprise; she'd never seen a talking Pal, at least not one that could communicate in human language, but she wasn't going to start questioning it. "It's poison," she piped up, "We barely escaped with our lives."</p>

<p>"...and who might you be?" Jessie inquired.</p>

<p>"Guys, she saved my life..." Archer hurried to tell them, "She's stayed by my side all this time."</p>

<p>"Well in all fairness," added Zoe, "He saved my life too."</p>

<p>Jessie and James looked at each other. "It looks like an interesting story," observed Jessie, "but first things first, we need to get him an antidote before he gets any sicker."</p>

<p>"It kinda looks as if his body is fighting it," Meowth chimed in, "I can go get the medicine he needs from our team medic." Meowth didn't wait for an answer, he spun around as fast as his feline paws could go and ran out to the rest of the minions that were stationed outside the cabin.</p>

<p>Archer pressed further into the pillows, still shivering and feverish and half-wondering if he was still dreaming and his friends being here was hence yet another cruel trick of his imagination. His throat was so incredibly parched by now; his mind flitted aimlessly from one thing to another, directed by the fever's whims. He could hear James and Jessie talking with Zoe beside him but he didn't strain to focus on their words.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before the cat returned with the antidote.</p>

<p>"It's Heal Powder. Ya need to mix it with water and drink it down," Meowth explained.</p>

<p>Zoe immediately brought a cup with water and while Meowth mixed the powdered medicine into the liquid, she helped Archer sit up on bed.</p>

<p>She helped him hold the cup up to his mouth and he swallowed the contents slowly. "This stuff is damn bitter!" he complained.</p>

<p>"Just drink it," Jessie ordered, "The boss is going to want to hear everything you've gone through and probably have a lot of questions."</p><h2>Chapter 16 - Conquest of Territory ✅</h2>

<p>Archer had fully recovered by the next day, and went with Zoe to meet Giovanni who was set to fly in that morning.</p>

<p>Archer straightened his posture as the helicopter landed lightly on the grass and the boss of Team Rocket emerged, preceded as usual by his pet Persian.</p>

<p>As Archer stood at attention and saluted, he could sense Zoe beside him fidget with nervousness. He had already told her so much about his organization by now, and he knew she wanted to make a good impression.</p>

<p>He knew as well that what little she'd seen of Team Rocket, ever since they'd landed on Palpagos Island and reunited with him, awed her. The encampment James and Jessie set up here on the beach was a miniature fortress, having a number of large tents with turrets positioned defensively around the perimeter and several Meowth digging in the ground for gold, and some electric type Pokémon powering a small generator so that they even had electricity. They'd quickly established a pocket of modern life, and Archer knew it could only get better as they expanded further into the island.</p>

<p>Giovanni halted before him and said, "At ease. Archer...it's good to see you are alive. For a while we thought of the possibility that something had happened to you."</p>

<p>"The enemy did try," replied Archer, "but I had some help. Sir," he added, turning from Giovanni towards Zoe, "this is Zoe Rayne; she's the one I spoke to you about over the telephone. I owe her my life."</p>

<p>Giovanni extended a hand which Zoe shook briefly. "A pleasure to meet you Zoe. I believe a thank you is in order since you helped Archer in his time of need."</p>

<p>"It's an honor for me, sir...to meet the leader of Team Rocket in person," she replied.</p>

<p>Giovanni's Persian had walked up to Zoe and, evidently having come to a decision about her, gave a long meow and entwined itself around her legs. She smiled and petted the large cat, which reciprocated by purring.</p>

<p>"You have a charming..." Zoe hesitated briefly, and Archer could see she was now having the same dilemma, only in reverse, to the one he'd once had with naming the island creatures, "...Mau?"</p>

<p>"Persian," Giovanni corrected, adding, "It seems my <i>consigliere</i> approves of you. Not many people can claim such high honor. ...Let's go to my office on the yacht, it seems to have docked already."</p>

<p>They walked in the direction of the newly built ship dock. The Team Rocket minions had spent all night working on it so they now had a brand new boardwalk stretching out to where Giovanni's yacht had been anchored off the coast of the island. They boarded and went directly to Giovanni's office aboard the ship.</p>

<p>Much as in his casino office at Celadon City, there was a tapestry bearing Team Rocket's bright red R insignia. This hung on the wall behind a fine mahogany desk, with bookshelves and a globe to the side, but here there was also a wide window overlooking the ship deck as well as a wicker basket lined with blankets for Persian to curl up in when the sun streamed in at just the right angle.</p>

<p><i>At least the sun is as it should be on Palpagos Island,</i> thought Archer, who still found himself at a loss for answers when it came to many of the island's peculiarities.</p>

<p>"Everything is strange here; even the damn moon is upside down," Archer was remarking to his godfather as they all sat down.</p>

<p>Giovanni was blunt. "We're in the southern hemisphere. The sky looks different on this side of the equator."</p>

<p><i>That explains a lot,</i> thought Archer.</p>

<p>Dismissing the topic hence, Giovanni moved on to more pressing matters. "You said in our earlier conversation that you and Zoe acquired some schematics being delivered in an airplane supply drop?"</p>

<p>Archer nodded, and he handed Giovanni several documents.</p>

<p>"These are the blueprints," Archer explained, and as Giovanni began perusing the documents, he went on, "This island is full of natural resources. They've got gold and tumblestone everywhere in the sand; you barely have to mine for it. That's not all...iron ore, coal deposits...about the only think I think they lack is crude oil, judging from how Marcus was flying it in."</p>

<p>Giovanni looked up at him from the blueprints with interest. "Well, Archer, it seems like you've stumbled on a very literal gold mine."</p>

<p>Receiving the praise of his godfather was always something Archer viewed as an honor.</p>

<p>"...and you say that he receives these supply drops at least once a week?" asked Giovanni.</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Interesting. I'll call our chief scientist here to take a look at these schematics. These could prove useful to us."</p>

<p>"Apparently Marcus Dryden needs a material he calls plasteel to make those weapons."</p>

<p>"You mentioned it could be the same material we need for the Master Ball."</p>

<p>"He claimed it was."</p>

<p>"All the hassle it took to finally take over the Silph Company..." Giovanni reminisced, "only to find that we lacked the secret formula to manufacture their most valuable product. Now to have it practically fall in our laps...but you aren't sure how they make this plasteel?"</p>

<p>Archer gave a shake of his head. "All we know so far is it's some sort of blend using tumblestone, gold, and crude oil."</p>

<p>"Then the priority is figuring out what the exact amount is," Giovanni replied.</p>

<p>"For that, we may have to find out where Marcus has his factory," said Archer.</p>

<p>"It's only a matter of time that we do... We own the island and everything on it," Giovanni said. "There's a legal caveat, of course, because the territory was on record as a wildlife sanctuary we have to entertain some sort of an ecological delegation here as a condition of sale. That said, they know fully well they're expected to approve."</p>

<p>His brown eyes glinted with unspoken menace, and Archer returned a small smile at the thought.</p>

<p>"In any case," Giovanni continued speaking, "we're going to start construction on several developments, including drilling for oil."</p>

<p>"Sir, if they're having crude oil shipped from the mainland, wouldn't that mean Palpagos Island lacks it?" Archer asked, perplexed.</p>

<p>"I highly doubt there's no oil on this island. The fact Mr. Dryden is flying it in simply says he doesn't know enough about oil production to be aware of its existence here."</p>

<p>Both Archer and Zoe seemed more confused than ever. Giovanni glanced at Zoe.</p>

<p>"Do the townspeople use gas lamps?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Zoe replied.</p>

<p>"Crude oil is always found underneath natural gas reservoirs."</p>

<p>Jessie, James, and Meowth showed up then at the open door, and briefly knocked before their boss waved them in. Giovanni turned his attention back to Archer and Zoe. "We can resume this conversation later," he dismissed them.</p>

<p>Archer and Zoe bid farewell and accordingly left the office.</p><hr>

<p>Not long afterwards Archer saw an opportunity to show Zoe around the Team Rocket camp and introduce her to people. He started giving her a tour and crossed paths with his sister, Kris.</p>

<p>Even considering she was a fairly young recruit, it made sense Kris had been assigned to their present island operations, Archer reflected; she owned a Suicune, something that made her the pride and joy of Team Rocket since few trainers were privileged enough to have caught such a vaunted legendary. Luckily for them she had gleefully joined their ranks early on, because he couldn't imagine how the state of their organization might have been otherwise.</p>

<p>"Kris! There's someone I want you to meet; this is Zoe Rayne." He then turned to Zoe and said, "Zoe...this is my sister, Kris."</p>

<p>As the girls greeted each other amiably, Archer looked with surprise at what he saw his sister had.</p>

<p>"Kris, what the fuck is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>Kris was beaming. "I got myself a pride of miniature gold Suicune."</p>

<p>Her Suicune had settled itself importantly in the midst of several smaller animals. They were half the height of it and looked almost identical to the horned leopard, save that their fur and horns were brilliant gold, and instead of two long tails they had a single fluffy one tipped at the end like a Ninetales'. They all looked up at Archer, bored.</p>

<p>"You mean a pack," corrected Archer. "They have one bushy tail. They're canines, not cats. Where did you even get them?"</p>

<p>"Suicune went out for a run and came back with friends. So did Eevee," added Kris, glancing over at her other pet. Eevee was scampering around, playing tag with one of the white Eevee that were typical on the island.</p>

<p>Archer turned towards Zoe and motioned to the animals. "What do we call the shiny Eevee and the little Suicunes?"</p>

<p>"Cremis and Gildane," Zoe replied, gesturing to each one in turn, and then added, "…I never thought I'd hear a Gildane being referred to as little. They're typically hard to catch, but fairly common here on the shoreline near Feybreak Cove."</p>

<p>Kris' eyes opened wide. "Shiny Eevee and Suicune are common here?"</p>

<p>Around this time one of the minions walked in carrying a Pokémon under their arm. It was a little fox with a fiery tail and paws.</p>

<p>"Look what I caught," grinned the minion.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked another.</p>

<p>"A fox."</p>

<p>"I know it's a fox. What kind of a fox?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but I think it's a fire type."</p>

<p>"...really? With the fire on its paws I never woulda guessed."</p>

<p>A third minion walked by. "Hey, what's up?"</p>

<p>"I caught me a fox."</p>

<p>"Ooo, I want a fox. Where'd you find it?"</p>

<p>"Out on the meadow. It actually lets me carry it around and shoot fire at things."</p>

<p>"You serious? How'd you train it to do that?"</p>

<p>There was a small cluster of minions by the time Archer, Zoe, and Kris walked over.</p>

<p>One of the grunts pointed at the animal. "We don't know what kind of a Pokémon that is."</p>

<p>"It looks like a Vulpix."</p>

<p>"It only has one tail."</p>

<p>"That's a Nickit if I ever saw one," another chimed in.</p>

<p>"Come on. Nickit aren't fire type," yet one more commented, "That's got to be a form of Fennekin."</p>

<p>Kris pointed her Pokédex at the fox. On the device's screen was displayed:</p>

<p>
  <i>Pokémon unknown. No available data.</i>
</p>

<p>"It's a miracle, considering everything else here is pretty much a known Pokémon with a different type," Archer remarked.</p>

<p>Everyone turned accordingly towards Zoe.</p>

<p>"Around here we call them Foxparks," she said. "They're everywhere on this island. They prey on the Chikipi."</p>

<p>The Foxparks licked its lips at the thought of chicken.</p>

<p>"Zoe," Archer said tentatively, "where did we put the Chikipi we've been using for eggs?"</p>

<p>"They're in their Pal Spheres, safe and sound," she replied.</p>

<p>"Okay. Whenever it is we let them out to feed them we're going to have to make them a coop somewhere around here like what they had back at the cabin in Bamboo Groves. Something Foxparks-proof."</p>

<p>While the group was pondering the fate of the Chikipi in the paws of the Foxparks, Jessie and James showed up with their tagalong Meowth.</p>

<p>"Everyone," Jessie said, "go along your way and do whatever was assigned to you earlier. Archer, Kris, and Zoe...stay."</p>

<p>When the minions had dispersed, James addressed them. "Giovanni wants you three to come now to join the group going to speak to Zoe's Syndicate. He's on his way there now."</p><hr>

<p>The Syndicate encampment was not very far from where Team Rocket had set up their operations.</p>

<p>When they arrived, the Syndicate villagers greeted them warmly; much more warmly than they had first greeted Archer. How Zoe explained it to him later was such: if he was her husband, and the Team Rocket group were related in some fashion to him, then they were like in-laws and all one big happy family.</p>

<p>Introductions were made and the group sat down with the head of Team Rocket to discuss the situation. The tribe elders explained their situation and their concerns, while Zoe gave her opinion of it. Since they'd stopped eating the drugged food Marcus' army had been providing, they were starting to recover their memories slowly, including that of the 'ancient language' spoken by Archer and those from the mainland. Giovanni sat and listened intently to everyone and then spoke up himself.</p>

<p>"What has bowing your head to Colonel Marcus Dryden gotten you? You're reviled by the townsfolk. Marcus' group of minions, that which he refers to as 'the PIDF' has spread lies claiming your tribe, or 'the Syndicate' as you refer to yourselves, are poachers and thieves. Because of that, the townspeople hate you." Giovanni stopped talking briefly to let his words sink in.</p>

<p>"If that's the case, well then, I'm not sure what we can do," said one of the elders, looking around to the others there from the Syndicate, "It's hopeless for us I guess."</p>

<p>"No. It's not hopeless," Giovanni answered, "I have great interest in your island and all the bounty it can produce. I propose that your people join mine and together we shall rid the island of the scourge brought upon it by Colonel Dryden and his evil followers... It comes with a price, of course."</p>

<p>"Name your price, sir," proclaimed the elder.</p>

<p>"Complete loyalty to me," the Team Rocket boss explained, "Your youngsters will be trained to do battle, in the way not of mainland sportsmen or island mercenaries but of military warriors. Others will help with mining the precious rocks and mineral that are so plentiful here. Of course I will provide the most up to date equipment...it won't be picks and shovels...you shall be trained and your people will be advanced into modern day society."</p>

<p>"I believe we can all agree to what you ask of us," the elder said as all the others nodded in agreement. "We have seen how the one you call Archer fights, and it is impressive." Then seemingly having an afterthought, he asked, "...but other than modernizing our society and learning precision fighting, how will that help us to push away the threat of those who hate us?'</p>

<p>"Because," Giovanni said leaning back and looking at him straight in the eye, "When you become what they hate, they fear you."</p><h2>Chapter 17 - Meeting with the Enemy ✅</h2>

<p>"What the fuck do you mean, 'they're building a resort'?" Marcus was irate.</p>

<p>It was the first word he'd received about the Syndicate's recent activities, and the idea of their being so bold as to even attempt such a thing sounded ludicrous to his ears, if not outright impossible. The soldier standing before him fidgeted with unease.</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel...they've set up an oil rig on the eastern coast, gold and paldium mining operations in several locations around the island, and yes...they're building some kind of a tourist resort on the beach. Construction is proceeding exceptionally fast as well."</p>

<p>"They're a bunch of fuckwit primitives. They don't have the resources for that."</p>

<p>"They have help from the outside."</p>

<p>"Who the hell would that be?"</p>

<p>"The name of their commander is Giovanni Delavita."</p>

<p>"Delavita?" Marcus questioned, suddenly recalling something his mainland associate had once mentioned, "...The leader of Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>This bit of information took Marcus completely aback. He had vindictively been planning to fly over to the Syndicate encampment and get Faleris to strike some fear in them; it was only then that he began to realize the possible extent of the situation.</p>

<p>He should have anticipated intruders from the moment the island's cloaking device had been decimated, but they couldn't have come at a more inopportune time. He still did not have the weaponry he wanted for his mainland takeover. Granted, he had the materials being made, but without the schematics there was little more he could do but stockpile plasteel and await the next airplane shipment by Jett. He'd just gotten rid of one mainland troublemaker, or so he thought; could these newcomers be somehow linked to that man? Moreover, if they were in fact linked, were they as dangerous as Archer had been...?</p>

<p><i>I could call Jett and ask how much trouble these people could be...</i> Marcus considered, <i>but the last thing I need is her knowing about this.</i> Jett's involvement in providing items was necessary to him, up to a point, but he didn't exactly want her interference in what he viewed as an island affair.</p>

<p>"Go to the encampment under a flag of truce," he ordered. "I want to meet with Delavita."</p><hr>

<p>During all this time, Team Rocket had unequivocally established their presence on Palpagos Island.</p>

<p>They had indeed begun a lavish construction on the beachfront, with a multi-story structure of glass and fine marble, intended to eventually have an open seating area looking out to the ocean and a beautiful promenade with palm trees. Both the Pokémon they'd brought with them from the mainland and the newfound Pals they'd been wantonly capturing here on the island helped with the building, each creature assisting where its unique skills and moveset would do best.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Team Rocket was already making professional warriors out of Zoe Rayne's Syndicate. They were given the same training as Team Rocket minions, and they found training sessions went far easier than those back home with their average new recruits. The Syndicate members picked up on everything fast, and the hunting and survival experience they already had provided them another advantage. In between sparring matches and weapons training, all mastered skillfully within a few attempts, Archer could already see Zoe's group becoming a formidable force and the perfect Team Rocket alliance.</p>

<p>For as strong as they were in physical combat, they still needed Pokémon. A few had pets of their own that merely needed to be trained up to higher levels, but most of them did not have any, so one of the first things they all decided to do was go out and catch some.</p>

<p>A small cluster of Team Rocket and Syndicate members set out at moon-rise and in the course of one night caught many lizard Pals called Leezpunk, which wore their shed scales like a kind of hoodie, and several flightless vultures called Cawgnito – all of which Archer took one look at when they got back to camp in the morning and immediately labelled "regional variants of Scrafty" and "Murkrow-Mandibuzz knock-offs" with no further consideration given to the matter.</p>

<p>"The ones who will really be able to say what they are will be the ecological delegation that's supposed to show up sometime in the next few days," said James.</p>

<p>"The way I see it the delegation is just going to be an annoyance," Archer commented.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but if we're going to make a profit off these critters back in Kanto we may as well know what to properly call them."</p>

<p>"What's there to know? Look at them. You can't tell me that's not a Mandibuzz." He pointed at one of the Cawgnito, which was strutting about with its species' quick, bobbing steps. "And its not like the average trainer really cares, so long as it's something rare they can show off in a battle."</p>

<p>"That looks nothing like a Mandibuzz."</p>

<p>"It eats carrion, and it has the same feather crest of a Murkrow."</p>

<p>"It's just a damn bird," James cast aside the notion. "The face covering is more like that of a <i>Cubone</i>."</p>

<p>"I knew it was a knock-off of something," declared Archer, vindicated.</p>

<p>A sharp squawk from Cawgnito made them all turn to see when Foxparks bit it from behind. The bird vaulted about, lunging to peck as the fox ran off with a mouth full of pilfered tail feathers and cackling with laughter.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on your fox," Archer chided at the Foxparks' trainer across the way.</p>

<p>Nearby, he noticed Kris with her pet Eevee and the wild Cremis. She was trying to pull the two little animals away from a slice of cake that they were both devouring.</p>

<p>"Don't eat so much!" Kris was chiding them, "You'll both get indigestion! ...Look at this Archer, I turned my back on my plate for one minute and the Eevees raid it."</p>

<p>This brought forth a small chuckle from Archer. "You ought to get them the honeymoon suite once the top floor of the resort's finished. Around here sharing cake is considered a marriage," he quipped.</p>

<p>At this point Jessie came over with Meowth padding beside her.</p>

<p>"As per the boss' orders," Jessie said, standing decisively with her hands on her hips, "we need to get a group of minions and head off with him to a meeting requested by that guy, Marcus."</p>

<p>Archer smirked. "Well now," he said, "Won't it be interesting for him to see I'm still alive."</p><hr>

<p>Once the group was gathered, they all marched to where their boss' transport vehicles were waiting. They stood in formation for Giovanni a few minutes and when he showed up, he snapped his fingers as he got into his limousine, giving them the signal to get into their cars.</p>

<p>The journey was fairly swift, but it probably would have been a longer travel time if they had not been using modern transportation. The island's lush vistas sped past as they headed direct to the meeting-spot. They had agreed to meet in a clearing that was a midpoint between the town where Marcus had his offices, and the Syndicate and Team Rocket encampments.</p>

<p>When they arrived, they found Marcus Dryden and several of his soldiers already there. As the Team Rocket entourage pulled up and stepped into view, Archer could see a few of the soldiers looked awed at their mode of transport – certainly astonishing compared to the islanders' typical mounts and horse-carts. He wondered if this was the first time many of them had ever seen modern vehicles.</p>

<p>Their leader was also astonished for a far different reason. Marcus took one look at Archer and went pale. He stood there, stunned into silence for a couple of minutes until Giovanni broke the ice.</p>

<p>"It is not easy to eliminate a Team Rocket agent," he said simply.</p>

<p>"Well, ahhhh," stammered Marcus.</p>

<p>"Let's get down to business," Giovanni said, waving off Marcus' concern. "I believe you asked me here because you are curious about my real estate development?"</p>

<p>Forcing himself to stop staring at the presumably resurrected Archer, Marcus Dryden recovered his voice and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Delavita, I wondered just exactly what are your plans for Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>"We're going to transform the island into the premier tourism destination of this century," Giovanni replied, "Resort hotel and casino, proper Pokémon Centers and marts at walking distance from human settlements, not to mention we're taking the old colosseum you have and bringing it up to date."</p>

<p>"The arena?" asked Marcus quizzically.</p>

<p>"We're building a new one... for sport battling, not these bloody duels you locals seem to favor," Giovanni said. "We'll have an annual tournament where we invite the strongest trainers to compete, with the exotic landscape and wildlife as a backdrop. We're going to bring civilization back to Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>"The fact you're civilized is exactly why you should be afraid to go against my army. We don't have such a weakness," Marcus threatened.</p>

<p>"Colonel Dryden I'm surprised you see it that way, considering you've previously met me," Archer spoke up confidently. "Civilization doesn't mean you don't know how to wield a spear. It just means you know how to smile at your enemy before stabbing them through the back."</p>

<p>Giovanni turned to Marcus. "Explain," he said, "Why are you against developing the island? Development brings profit."</p>

<p>"You're the only one getting the profit!" exclaimed Marcus. "What do you see us as, your own personal money-making Mozzarina?"</p>

<p>Giovanni glanced over to Archer nonchalantly, who translated, "Cash cow."</p>

<p>Giovanni leant towards Marcus, and looking him straight into the eyes said, "I am making an effort to be nice, which you are undeserving of. Get off my island or face the consequences."</p>

<p>"How dare you speak to me in that manner!" shouted Marcus, "What makes you think you can do that?"</p>

<p>"I own the island."</p>

<p>"You can't legally own an entire island," he countered.</p>

<p>"I purchased it legally and officially from the planetary council. They have little interest in trying to manage developing a third-world holdout with the myriad violations of human rights you purport as typical here; so little interest, in fact, they were more than happy to relinquish this whole tiny region to me."</p>

<p>"Well, one thing is paperwork. Another thing is reality…and that's one of the things we value on Palpagos Island – crude reality. I don't give a damn what documents were signed on the mainland. I'm going to put it bluntly, Mr. Delavita," said Marcus, hardly able to hide his seething, "You're on my island."</p>

<p>Giovanni snapped his fingers and instantaneously, the Team Rocket minions standing behind him pulled out guns and pointed them decisively at the PIDF soldiers. Marcus' eyes showed sudden fear but it was not until Giovanni pulled out his own gun from inside his suit that the emotion became outright shock.</p>

<p>Giovanni aimed it directly at Marcus and then with a swiftness that displayed years of experience, moved his wrist and shot at the soldier standing to Marcus' left. The man stumbled backwards and fell lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>There was momentary silence and Giovanni spoke:</p>

<p>"You're on <i>my</i> island. I rule. Team Rocket now requires payment for the list of provisions and generosities we've allotted you."</p>

<p>Giovanni kept his eyes on the silent Marcus and extended his hand to one of his guards who produced a piece of paper upon which was written a lengthy list of items. The Team Rocket boss gave it to Marcus who read it over once and then looked back up at Giovanni.</p>

<p>"You've only just arrived here and you're demanding we pay you money for the privilege of hunting game on private land," he said adding, "for having built towns here, and for protection?"</p>

<p>"You know how to read, I see."</p>

<p>"And this," added Marcus with indignation, "Retroactive compensation for <i>manufacturing Pal Spheres without your approval</i>?"</p>

<p>"Considering I own all major manufacturers of Poké Balls, I'm doing you a favor by overlooking the fact you're essentially an unlicensed competitor in the market."</p>

<p>"You really think you can just show up and flaunt power and have me submit?"</p>

<p>"I'm doing you another favor," added Giovanni icily, "by not killing you right now."</p>

<p>"Fuck you. I'll have it all," responded Marcus, and without waiting for an answer turned sharply and left, as his men gathered up the body of their dead compatriot and followed him.</p>

<p>Giovanni put away his gun, turned to his associates and announced, "Interesting how there are still unreasonable people in this world." He then turned specifically to Jessie and James and ordered, "Keep everyone on training schedules… War approaches."</p><hr>

<p>They didn't have to wait very long for the war to start.</p>

<p>Archer was minding his own business along the beach when there was a flash of light, and what should appear before him but a cluster of Unowns. They squeaked a cheery greeting.</p>

<p>"You guys again! It's been a while," Archer returned their greeting, and then took a wary step backwards. "You'd better not be planning another surprise trip for me."</p>

<p>The Unowns squeaked and turned about in mid-air, reorganizing their positions to spell:</p>

<p>TOMORROW ATTACK DAWN</p>

<p>"...what?" Archer inquired, confused.</p>

<p>The Unowns, apparently deciding they couldn't be bothered to elaborate, surrounded Archer in a wide circle. He barely had time to react before there was a flash of light and he was once more teleported away.</p>

<p>Thankfully this time he didn't go far; they warped him to Giovanni's office on the yacht, and came along with him.</p>

<p>Giovanni was on the telephone. At a meow from Persian he acknowledged Archer and the Unowns with a cursory glance, but otherwise he was unfazed and seamlessly continued the conversation he was in the middle of as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.</p>

<p>Archer fidgeted, wondering if he ought to step out, but an adamant squeak from one of the Unowns made him conclude he ought to stay put – otherwise they'd just zap him back in here, as easily as one might recall a rambunctious young Pokémon to their Poké Ball.</p>

<p>It returned uneasy recollections of past experiences, but at least he knew these little creatures bore him no ill intent, even if they <i>were</i> mischievous beyond his liking. He tried to push his bothersome memories away.</p>

<p>From what he deduced, whomever Giovanni was talking with was on Kanto's Pokémon League commission.</p>

<p>"...naturally there will be some overlap with the main League challenge when it comes to viewership, so I intend for the Palpagos Island competitions to take place in the summer," Giovanni was saying.</p>

<p>On the other line, outside of Archer's range of hearing, the League commissioner sounded confused.</p>

<p>"Palpagos Island...?" he echoed blankly.</p>

<p>"The former wildlife sanctuary I own in the southern hemisphere," Giovanni elaborated.</p>

<p>It took a moment before he succeeded in refreshing the man's memory.</p>

<p>"...oh, right, that island. Everyone here has totally forgotten about that Pal-island place. Whatever happened with it; did you raze the town there already?"</p>

<p>"That's coming soon," said Giovanni with nonchalance, "but I want to get the League's official endorsement of our planned battle tournaments for when we open up to tourists."</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll be no problem. You know I'm always able to do a favor for my esteemed friend, Mr. Delavita," he hurried to say, trying to hide the fearful quiver in his voice.</p>

<p>"Then it's settled," Giovanni smirked knowingly, "I'll expect the Pokémon League's public endorsement of the event shortly."</p>

<p>A victorious Giovanni hung up the telephone and turned his attention over to Archer.</p>

<p>"Sir," began Archer, "the Unowns apparently have brought a message."</p>

<p>"I see they deem it urgent," observed Giovanni, with a glance at the Pokémon. The Unowns rotated about to spell the same enigmatic statement they'd written earlier:</p>

<p>TOMORROW ATTACK DAWN</p>

<p>Persian gave two or three meows and a chirp. One of the Unowns answered with a long conversation of chattering squeaks, and then Persian flattened its ears and turned to Giovanni.</p>

<p>One of Giovanni's many great qualities, Archer thought with admiration, was how he could understand the cat. Giovanni listened as Persian translated the Unown's message into meows, ending with a pointed hiss, and then the don gave a wily half-smile.</p>

<p>"Well, this will make the game interesting," he replied. Persian squinted and coiled its tail about its paws.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Archer, who couldn't understand any of these animals.</p>

<p>"It appears Mr. Dryden thinks he can attack our encampment at dawn and wipe us off the face of our island," Giovanni said, turning to address Archer. "The Unown overheard it and, since they're both grateful for you helping them and – according to their own words – want to make Dryden's life miserable, they've come to warn us."</p>

<p>The Unown all squeaked in happy unison, glad that their message had been accurately conveyed.</p>

<p>"Time to show Mr. Dryden how Team Rocket functions," said Giovanni.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Archer, "don't we have the delegation arriving fairly soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we do. But I'm sure we can steer them away from any unfortunate occurrence while we deal with things," Giovanni dismissed. "They're supposed to arrive within a couple of days and should only be here as long as it takes for the necessary documents to be signed. Then no one can dispute our rule over this island."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," Archer replied.</p>

<p>"Also, I invite the Unowns to stay with us. Their alliance is welcome. I would say we should offer them something to eat but quite honestly I'm not sure <i>what</i> they eat. I'll ask Dr. Colress when he gets here; he'll be flying in around the same time as the delegation does to assist us with deciphering the weaponry schematics."</p>

<p>One of the Unowns twirled about and a few of the others squeaked cheerily. Archer gave them a skeptical look but said nothing. <i>Better they be on our side, especially since they're troublesome little letters.</i></p><hr>

<p>The Team Rocket camp was in a flurry of activity all night long, and when dawn arrived everyone was in their designated spot awaiting the presumed ambush by the PIDF. Colonel Dryden's group did not disappoint.</p>

<p>From where he was hidden, Archer could see their shadows coming up the trail and filtering in between the tree trunks. As they got nearer, he could see the soldier leading them wore the uniform of a PIDF lieutenant. <i>A pity,</i> thought Archer. <i>I was kind of hoping Marcus would show up himself so we could thrash him. I guess he's not that dumb.</i></p>

<p>Before they were able to breach the encampment Archer gave a signal, and within moments the PIDF squadron found themselves not conducting an offensive but unequivocally on the defensive, having been quickly surrounded by enemy forces.</p>

<p>The Syndicate group were all aiming weapons far more advanced than even the machine guns their enemies carried, with their Pals right beside them growling with eagerness for the fight. Even if they could have possibly gotten through that line, standing behind the Syndicate as an ominous promise were countless Team Rocket agents with their own highly trained Pokémon and top-class weaponry.</p>

<p>"Didn't come prepared for trouble, did ya?" a feline voice taunted. The astounded lieutenant leading the invading forces turned around and found himself face to face with James, Jessie, and Meowth. They stood imperiously on a platform right outside the encampment, a gleam of murder in their eyes and a bazooka pointed straight at him.</p>

<p>Archer made his way through the squadron of Team Rocket minions to stand in front of the lieutenant; the Team Rocket admin could see at that moment the whole PIDF squadron had realized how outmatched the fight was and that they were going to get obliterated.</p>

<p>He suppressed laughter under the subtlety of a smile. "You can turn back, and tell Marcus Dryden to start making arrangements for his funeral...or you can come in, and we'll hold yours now."</p>

<p>The crude simplicity of this threat made the lieutenant rethink the invasion. With an unspoken directive, the PIDF army meekly retreated.</p><hr>

<p>Marcus was in his office. He'd sent his soldiers out to strike at Team Rocket's camp and was waiting to get word that his orders had been carried out. The day had dawned cloudy and promised rain. "Perfect to wash away the outsiders' bloodstains once my forces reclaim the beach from them," Marcus had said maliciously.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, and he looked up to see the lieutenant who had been sent out earlier to lead the invasion. The lieutenant saluted, and Marcus immediately beckoned him in.</p>

<p>"I trust the intruders are all dead or dying by now?" Marcus said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant drew in a breath, but proceeded to relate what had transpired. Marcus listened to it all without comment or outward reaction, and when the lieutenant had finished the account, the first thing Marcus said was:</p>

<p>"You ungrateful army of cowards."</p>

<p>The accusation was delivered with no scarcity of vitriol. His lieutenant fidgeted under his superior's scathing glare.</p>

<p>"Colonel, we would have been annihilated..."</p>

<p>"You should have called their bluff. Of all the inept decisions you could have made, this one makes us look like damned fools!" Marcus snapped.</p>

<p>In the midst of this conversation, another of the PIDF soldiers raced into the office. His face was pale with fear, and he saluted his commander briskly before blurting out:</p>

<p>"Sir, we have a problem. They've got the town surrounded."</p>

<p>Marcus whirled about to face him. "<i>What</i>?"</p>

<p>"Team Rocket and their Syndicate allies," the infantryman explained, nearly stammering the words with frightened urgency. "They've engaged us in battle and they're moving into the town perimeter. Our forces can't repel them."</p>

<p>Marcus turned back to his lieutenant, who was in a state of utter shock. "It's bad enough you failed in your orders, you inadvertently led them here!"</p>

<p>Before the lieutenant could even react, Marcus pulled out his revolver and shot him. He reeled back and collapsed to the floor, dead.</p>

<p>Marcus hurried outside with Faleris' Pal Sphere clutched in his hand. A thin drizzle was cascading down on the town square, which was beginning to form puddles, and all the townspeople had retreated inside their dwellings as if anticipating the worst. Distantly, from the far outskirts of the settlement, came the raging noise of a large-scale Pokémon battle alongside the shooting of rifles; the sounds melded together in a nondescript manner, till it was easy to be unsure which were gunfire and which were energy attacks.</p>

<p>He sent out Faleris, which glanced over its shoulder at him as he got on its back, as if asking where he'd like to go.</p>

<p>"The plasteel factory would be the safest place to hide right now," conceded Marcus, and the bird accordingly stretched its wings and took flight.</p>

<p>A short time after Marcus Dryden fled, the town was invaded by a horde of both Team Rocket and Syndicate members working in tandem. They killed the guards and took the whole town in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>The townspeople were mostly quiet folks and submissive. The tales told them by Marcus' group, of the Rayne Syndicate being ruthless poachers and outlaws, had impressed heavily on them. However, they were also not particularly loyal to the old PIDF administration either; they were perfectly willing to bow their heads to whomever ruled so long as they could live in peace, and if the Syndicate and their evident Team Rocket superiors had no intention of slaughtering them – well then, they were all willing to hail Giovanni.</p>

<p>Giovanni settled in immediately to the PIDF's former headquarters, replacing their shield emblem with the Team Rocket tapestry and Faleris' gold perch with a gilded cat tree for Persian.</p>

<p>On this particular day, Giovanni asked for Zoe to be brought to his office. Archer arrived quickly with her and stood at attention as Giovanni asked her some questions.</p>

<p>Giovanni addressed Zoe first. "How many towns are there on this island?"</p>

<p>"Three," she replied, "but this is the biggest. Besides this one, there's Fisherman's Point and Feybreak Cove."</p>

<p>"...and how many soldiers does the PIDF routinely assign to defend these two towns?"</p>

<p>"Not many," Zoe considered, "though I don't know if they maintain hidden strongholds near them. Usually there's only a handful of guards at the town entrance."</p>

<p>"Very well," Giovanni said, "Thank you for the information. You may go on your way until I ask for you again."</p>

<p>As Zoe stepped out of the Team Rocket boss' office, Archer immediately leapt.</p>

<p>"Shall I organize a scouting party to investigate the towns ahead of attack?" He was always quick to grab any chance to impress his godfather and assist Team Rocket in the process.</p>

<p>Giovanni, contrarily, shook his head. "Archer, at ease. You know you don't have to be proving yourself all the time."</p>

<p>"Sir, it's not a holdover from—" and he cut off, a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>Maybe it was an echo, deep in his mind, of that time he was held captive and being used as a pawn. Of being expected to accomplish everything or suffer torture. Of being told his life was useless otherwise.</p>

<p>"It's not," Giovanni acknowledged, snapping Archer's attention back to the moment, "Even before you were taken prisoner, you've routinely striven to do as much as possible for Team Rocket's glory...often to a fault. You're overworking yourself. I'll be sending detachments of lower-rank agents to scout out the other towns. ...Besides, I have a more important assignment for you."</p>

<p>The despondency Archer had been starting to feel immediately vanished as Giovanni went on:</p>

<p>"Marcus has something we want and need; he's not a reasonable man by any stretch of the imagination."</p>

<p>"So then, we would need to simply help ourselves to whatever," said Archer nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to sneak into his factory and steal the formula they're using for plasteel," Giovanni ordered. "Once we have that, Team Rocket can produce anything we want – from Master Balls to weapons currently in the realm of fiction."</p>

<p>"Are the weapons really that novel?" Archer remarked.</p>

<p>"Extremely," Giovanni emphasized. "In that, Colonel Dryden is right; it's something the mainland would be astounded by. According to our top scientist Dr. Colress, the schematics are for a new kind of laser weapon far more powerful than even a Pokémon's Hyper Beam. That said, with how small Dryden's militia is, I still think his invasion of the mainland regions, if it came to fruition, could be knocked down by sheer numbers...if not downright outwitted by the military strategizing they sorely lack."</p>

<p>"Either way it behooves Team Rocket to make those laser weapons first," concluded Archer.</p>

<p>"The plasteel factory is located somewhere in the moorland of Hypocrite Hill." Giovanni gestured to the map before him. "Scouts with bird Pokémon have been able to sight it from above, but it's in such a protected area that it would be impossible to attack by air. Because of this, we'll have to take precautions and approach the area stealthily."</p>

<p>A small smile passed over Archer's lips. "When do I set out?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," Giovanni affirmed. "You'll take some of our younger cadets, as well as Zoe and a few of her people with you. This will be the first major mission any of the Syndicate recruits go on...they could use the extra practice."</p><h2>Chapter 18 - The Long and the Short of it ✅</h2>

<p>Early at dawn, Archer and Zoe set out for the journey to find the plasteel factory, commanding a joint group of five Team Rocket and five Syndicate minions.</p>

<p>One of the Team Rocket minions who had come along was Archer's sister, Kris. However, she'd left both her Pokémon – Suicune and Eevee – back at the encampment. Once she'd heard the horror story about the enemy's 'Pal Essence Condenser' and how they would incinerate stolen Pokémon to power up their own, she quickly decided that her prized Suicune would be better off protecting the construction site from a possible enemy raid, and Eevee ought to stay behind as well to accompany its new friend Cremis; the white-furred Eevee was moody lately and kept hiding in cubbyholes around the base, or so Kris claimed.</p>

<p>Whereupon Archer drearily pointed out that she needed to bring at least one Pokémon along for protection, even if it was something as mediocre as a Ratatta or a Zubat. She dutifully grabbed a Chikipi from the coop.</p>

<p>"It seems we have two ways we can go," Archer said as he studied the map. "The first is the shortest, down this path, then we veer off when we get to the river and follow it till we reach our destination."</p>

<p>"And the second?" asked Zoe.</p>

<p>"The second way means cutting through the woods, past a gully that's located somewhere around here... That'll send us through the deepest parts of Verdant Brook, past Gobfin Turf, and finally to Hypocrite Hill." He hesitated and stared dubiously at the name, as if he still wasn't quite sure whether it was a typographical error.</p>

<p>"Seriously? We're better off taking the straightforward path," said Zoe. "The road has already been cleared, and there aren't many dangerous Pals in that area unless you deliberately pick a fight. The long way there, however, is full of hazards, and Hypocrite Hill is especially treacherous."</p>

<p>"Is that why they call it Hypocrite Hill?"</p>

<p>"No one remembers why they call it Hypocrite Hill."</p>

<p>"Of course they don't."</p>

<p>"It's supposed to date back to the island war; that's all anyone really remembers."</p>

<p>Archer was still scrutinizing the map, in particular the place called Gobfin Turf. "...What the hell is a Gobfin?"</p>

<p>"Land-sharks."</p>

<p>"What the hell is a land-shark?"</p>

<p>She seemed a little gratified to have discovered a species neither he nor any of the mainland people were apparently aware of in the slightest. "Once you see them, you don't forget."</p>

<p>"I know!" Kris chimed in, flipping out her Pokédex. "Is it this?"</p>

<p>On the Pokédex screen, there was a picture of a rotund little dragon with sharp teeth and a sharklike fin on its head. It read:</p>

<p>
  <i>Gible<br />
Type: Dragon-Ground<br />
It once lived in the tropics. Gible attacks anything that moves, and it drags whatever it catches into the crevice that is its lair.</i>
</p>

<p>"God I hope not," frowned Archer.</p>

<p>"Gobfin are <i>sort</i> of like that..." considered Zoe, studying the image, "but they're not as cute."</p>

<p>Archer glanced at her, questioning. "You think Gible are cute?"</p>

<p>"They're cuter than Gobfin," Zoe replied.</p>

<p>"Okay...even more reason to take the short way to our destination. Short way it is," decided Archer.</p><hr>

<p>As anticipated, the journey was relatively peaceful.</p>

<p>It was a straightforward trek across a wide forest path. The sun was shining and the trees were full of birdsong, though try as Archer might he could not determine what species was singing – it was a beautiful trill somewhere between the song of a Starly and a Taillow, and whatever bird it was had ensconced itself deeply in the foliage.</p>

<p>They actually saw very few wild animals, except for a few Lamball and a distant Mozzarina, all of which as Zoe had said kept to themselves and posed no danger to the travelling party. It actually reminded Archer somewhat of the peace of traversing routes back home, and it might have even been easy to forget an enemy army was out there somewhere, waiting for the right moment to launch an attack and turn the tranquil forest into a raging war zone.</p>

<p>None of their Pokémon seemed at all concerned by this, however. Frostallion in particular pranced ahead, evidently relishing that it was the mount of one of the squadron commanders, and every so often Archer had to gently pull back on the reins to keep it from trotting too far from the others.</p>

<p>When night fell, they set up camp in a secluded area of the forest, sheltered beneath a canopy of trees below one of the tall cliffs.</p>

<p>Several campfires were set up and some tents as well. Most minions were still awake since Team Rocket always had guards posted when they camped.</p>

<p>"Well, in any case, this seems like a good spot to stop for awhile and feed the critters."</p>

<p>They settled down in the grass to rest and let all the Pokémon out of their Poké Balls to feed them.</p>

<p>Frostallion, Rapidash, and the other large Pokémon they had as transportation grazed peaceably off to the side. The Leezpunk and Cawgnito belonging to the Syndicate tamers began running around and playing with the Raticate, Golbat, Grimer, and Liepard that were of Team Rocket, while some of the smaller animals sat beside their trainers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Houndoom trotted over to Archer with a stick it had found in the grass, tail wagging as it placed it at his feet and barked. He dutifully tossed the stick, and the dog spun about and raced after to snatch it in mid-air and promptly return for him to throw it again.</p>

<p>As the dog bolted after the stick for the third time, Archer glanced over at Zoe. She was reclining against a rock staring at the bonfire flames, deep in thought.</p>

<p>The flame-light flickered across Zoe's gentle features; especially those amethyst eyes, which caught the glow akin to the jewels they so effortlessly resembled. He'd never really stopped to admire her, at least not in this way. <i>She is pretty,</i> he thought.</p>

<p>She spoke, snapping him out of his brooding thoughts. "Is this sort of what it's like, journeying on the mainland?"</p>

<p>Archer blinked pensively. He'd almost forgotten when it was he'd mentioned how trainers elsewhere would go out collecting gym badges. His recollections now hearkened back to that night they'd travelled from the Syndicate camp to the town, and camped out beneath the openness of Palpagos Island's strange sky. Zoe smiled and added:</p>

<p>"I remember the tales you told me about how Pal tamers off the island travel from place to place, testing their skills against one another in friendly battles, and exploring the wilderness for fun... Come to think of it I don't ever remember voyaging through the island woods with the kind of camaraderie we have here, ever."</p>

<p>"Yeah it is," said Archer. "It's exactly like this...minus having to look over your shoulder for something that wants to eat you."</p>

<p>He looked awkwardly away from Zoe, glancing over to see his sister sharing pieces of her sandwich with the Chikipi sitting on her lap in a ball of feathers.</p>

<p>"Kris, is there any Pokémon you get that you <i>don't</i> coddle?"</p>

<p>"All Pokémon grow through friendship," she said with a smile. "I should think even more if you're calling them a Pal."</p>

<p>The Chikipi clucked and tilted its head to look up at her.</p>

<p>Archer looked dubious. "That Chikipi already knows Hyper Beam. I doubt it will learn anything stronger."</p>

<p>"Maybe it will evolve," said Kris.</p>

<p>Zoe had overheard the conversation and joined in. "No one has seen a Pal evolve on this island in a long time."</p>

<p>Even Archer now glanced at her with surprise. This bit of information was unexpected, and she elaborated.</p>

<p>"We kind of know they do..." Zoe told him, "it's just no one's really witnessed it. For instance there are large birds we call Penking that some say are the evolution of Pengullet, though an equal number of people say they're not related to Pengullet at all."</p>

<p>"They sound like they could be Empoleon," considered Archer, "the evolution of Piplup."</p>

<p>Zoe shrugged. "If you say Pengullet evolve on the mainland, I have to take your word for it."</p>

<p>"Well," interjected Kris, "even if this chicken doesn't evolve, I still like it." She gave it a hug.</p>

<p>This led Archer to point out the obvious. "You brought the Chikipi along so you wouldn't suffer if something happens to your pets. Now you're getting attached to it and are going to be upset if it gets grabbed by our enemies."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," admitted Kris, "I've always had an affinity for animals."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's okay," Archer smiled; he was thankful that his sister had that sort of gift where most Pokémon naturally bonded with her, and decided not to pursue the issue. </p>

<p>Kris noticed the chicken was now trying to hide its head under a wing. "Are you sleepy, Chicki?" she asked it.</p>

<p>Then she looked up and noticed one of the Team Rocket minions, sitting a sort distance away. He was the one who had caught the Foxparks; his Pokémon had fixed its eyes intently on Chikipi.</p>

<p>"Your fox keeps staring at my chicken," Kris informed the minion.</p>

<p>"I think Foxparks is hungry," he replied, looking at the fire type.</p>

<p>Not waiting for a fight to begin, the fox flattened its ears and trotted off.</p>

<p>"It's interesting that Foxparks won't stick around. I know it's hungry but we can find some food for it to eat," commented Archer.</p>

<p>The topic of conversation turned to something else, and it was several minutes later they heard a commotion coming from inside the forested area.</p>

<p>Suddenly Foxparks raced back into the camp, ears flat and eyes wild. There was a crash as a tree toppled and they looked up to see one of the huge grass elephants.</p>

<p>Archer took one look at it coming towards them and grimaced. "Zoe, why does that elephant look pissed?"</p>

<p>The Mammorest slammed its hooves down and a shock wave exploded outwards from it, nearly knocking them down in an Earthquake attack. Kris gave a frightened outcry and a few of the Syndicate minions reached for their weapons.</p>

<p>"I told you not to bite the locals!" exclaimed the Foxparks' trainer.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here!" shouted Archer. They wasted no time; they all mounted their Pokémon and ran away as fast as they could. The ground shook as the massive beast galloped after them.</p>

<p>The chase sent the small group weaving through the forest, underbrush snapping and trees crashing down behind them as the furious Mammorest kept in pursuit. Just as suddenly they found themselves at a narrow rope bridge suspended across a steep ravine.</p>

<p>"Across the bridge!" cried Zoe, and they all hurtled over the bridge.</p>

<p>For a rope bridge, it was surprisingly sturdy. They had gone halfway across when the Mammorest reached the bridge as well.</p>

<p>Too large to get across the narrow way, the elephant swung its head and unleashed spinning leaves that sliced through the air above them. It barely missed hitting the bridge, which swayed.</p>

<p>"We're going to fall!" someone shouted.</p>

<p>"Foxparks, use Flamethrower!" its trainer ordered, holding out the fox.</p>

<p>"Wait...!" Archer tried to halt him, too late.</p>

<p>Foxparks opened its mouth; fire blazed from its jaws towards the Mammorest. The elephant trumpeted in pain as some of the flames seared against its hide, and backed away.</p>

<p>The flames also hit the rope holding up the bridge.</p>

<p>"Go!" Zoe said, pushing at everyone to race the rest of the way across the bridge. They made a run for it and reached the other side, right as the burning rope snapped and the bridge crumbled into the ravine.</p>

<p>They all clustered breathlessly on the other side of the ravine. The angry Mammorest raised its trunk and trumpeted noisily but couldn't reach them.</p>

<p>It was Foxparks who broke the silence, giving a little yap and tugging at its trainer's sleeve. "Guys...Foxparks is still hungry."</p>

<p>"Okay, so long way it is," decided Archer.</p>

<p>With no further fanfare he motioned to the others and walked away from the cliff.</p><hr>

<p>The small group of Team Rocket and Syndicate members spent so much time running away from the elephant that by the time they were able to shake it off, the sun rose. Archer was angry.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous," he said with an exasperated voice, "There's no way to find a good location at this point to make another camp, plus it's not wise to keep walking because we'll fall victim to exhaustion, and a warrior is not as effective or efficient if he's exhausted...so here we will stay for a few hours until we recover."</p>

<p>Everyone nodded. They were tired, and what Archer said made perfect sense.</p>

<p>After a few hours of napping, Archer gave the signal to regroup and they set out again.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a rise overlooking a marshland, with thin waterways peeling through mangroves and muddy sand. The land seemed barren of animals.</p>

<p>Archer was about to give the order to head forth and cut through the marshes, when Zoe held him back.</p>

<p>"That's Gobfin Turf," she said, motioning down to the marshland.</p>

<p>Archer gave the landscape a second look; perhaps because he'd been so used to Gible living in rocky terrain, he had presumed Gobfin Turf would be full of caverns. Seeing it now, this was worse. Marshlands were notoriously difficult to fight in.</p>

<p>"I don't see any Pokémon down there," he observed tentatively.</p>

<p>They descended the cliffs with ginger steps. Zoe and the rest of the Syndicate group were especially on high alert, while Archer, Kris, and the rest of the Team Rocket agents uncertainly watched the landscape around them as they walked. They weren't quite sure what they were supposed to be looking for.</p>

<p>It was Archer who first caught sight of it – a faint disturbance on the water, like a gust of wind when there was none. As he stared at the rippling spot, he was met with two shining eyes beneath the murkiness of the water that were fixedly staring back up at him.</p>

<p>He jumped back at the same time as the creature vaulted out of the water, snapping to bite him. Just as suddenly, he heard a cry from some of the squadron ahead also faced with belligerent wild Gobfin, and bursts of light flashed across the marsh as mainland Poké Balls and island Pal Spheres all opened at once to send out their pets for the fight.</p>

<p>Gobfin were everywhere. There were dozens of them; snarling, savage beasts with the fins and teeth of Sharpedo and the bulky forearms of Machop. Their Pokémon were knocking them out, but for each one that fainted more kept coming in waves.</p>

<p>Archer clenched his teeth as another one lunged for him and his Houndoom tackled it back. "Most wild Pokémon would've backed down by now. These things don't quit!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"We're not going to make it to the other side of the marsh," Zoe shouted at him from across the way, where she was commanding her Pengullet to strike enemies with its ice attacks. "There are too many of them."</p>

<p>"I've had enough of this," Archer declared. He raised his rifle and shot three of the Gobfin dead.</p>

<p>This now diverted the creatures' attention, and attracted by the scent of blood they all sprang on their fallen cohorts. <i>They're like damn piranhas,</i> he thought with disdain.</p>

<p>"Retreat!" cried Archer.</p>

<p>They all raced back the way they had come and ended up back on the precipice, watching the Gobfin tear into their meal.</p>

<p>"Is there any other way to Hypocrite Hill?" Archer asked, glancing at Zoe.</p>

<p>"Go around Gobfin Turf? We'll lose another two hours," she said.</p>

<p>"It'll have to do," Archer said, and as he turned to go he noticed a minion of Team Rocket walking around with a very tame Gobfin.</p>

<p>Archer eyed him with obvious incredulity. "You caught a Gobfin? Why the fuck do we need a Gobfin?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh for crying out....put it in its Poké Ball, at least until we're sure of the typical reactions it has!" Archer ordered, then turned back to Zoe and said, "Okay, so we'll go around Gobfin Turf, and as soon as we get back to camp, I'm going to advise Giovanni to consider paving over this damned marsh and make a plaza or something."</p>

<p>Kris, who was nearby, chimed in cheerily. "I don't think the Gobfins will like that."</p>

<p>"Fuck the Gobfin. I don't like Gobfin. Fucking land-sharks." Archer waved his hand for the squadron to follow him down the path and without saying anything more he walked ahead.</p><hr>

<p>They skirted the marshland, travelling along the cliff edge while keeping in distant sight of Gobfin Turf. At some point the trees began to grow thicker, and they moved away from the marshes and further into the deep cloak of leafy forest.</p>

<p>It was noon when they came to a wide clearing in the woodland with a statue of a Frostallion.</p>

<p>Frostallion had merely gotten one look of its likeness commemorated in stone and had straightened itself regally.</p>

<p>Archer lingered here. "So this must be the Frostallion statue you once told me about, commemorating their role in protecting the island."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the one," Zoe replied.</p>

<p>"I guess no one remembers what the threat was that they were supposed to have repelled," he presumed.</p>

<p>"Only that they brought winter to fight it off," she said.</p>

<p>Before the conversation could go any further, they heard propellers overhead and Archer gave the signal for everyone to get out of sight. Everyone ducked into the bracken, including the animals, as an airplane passed by over the tree branches; it dropped a package, and went on its way.</p>

<p>"Looks like we might not get our hands on another mysterious delivery this time," said Zoe, from where she knelt beside Archer. She pointed down the trail. "Some people are coming."</p>

<p>As they watched, a cart drawn by two Univolt – or, as Archer saw them, green-and-yellow striped Zebstrika – came down the forest path. Archer could see the driver was one of the PIDF soldiers, and other soldiers accompanied the cart too.</p>

<p>The cart slowed to a halt in the forest clearing, and the soldiers quickly loaded the large supply chest onto the back of the cart; then one of the men in the group took a seat at the helm of the wagon and turning the horses around, set them off at a trot.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Archer motioned to his small squadron.</p>

<p>"We're following them," he announced, "I have a hunch they'll take us straight to the factory – and the plasteel formula."</p><h2>Chapter 19 - Plasteel Factory ✅</h2>

<p>The cart with its two Univolt kept to a quick trot along the main path, with the drivers scanning the road ahead and the trees close by, all too preoccupied to glance up at the hills where the small group of Team Rocket and Syndicate members were silently trailing them. Stealth had always been one of Team Rocket's strong suits, and apparently one that Zoe's Syndicate also effortlessly embodied.</p>

<p><i>It's a good thing they haven't noticed us yet,</i> Archer thought, nevertheless, as their combined party followed the PIDF cart at a distance.</p>

<p>Before long they reached a clearing of flat land encircled by trees and low hills, and in the center they could see the factory building – a stone fortress enclosed by tall metal walls topped with barbed wire. Directly outside were two PIDF soldiers, and one of their trained Lamball behind a semi-circle of sandbags with a mounted machine gun.</p>

<p>Archer directed the group to linger in the cover of the trees, and they were able to spy on the goings-on below. The cart drew up to the factory building, whereupon the drivers pulled back on the Univolts' reins to halt them and then dismounted, with some words spoken to the posted guards that were completely out of hearing range of the Team Rocket observers. The PIDF soldiers took the supply drop chest down from the cart and went inside the building.</p>

<p>"Okay," said Archer, glancing at the minions, "Zoe and I will be infiltrating the factory. You fight any soldiers that run outside and make as big a show as you can. Wait for the signal; you'll realize when."</p>

<p>He motioned to Zoe to follow him, and they crept along the edge of the cliff away from the others till they had an angular view of the site with a direct line through the tree branches at the guards. Archer knelt down behind a rock, and Zoe crouched beside him.</p>

<p>"What's the plan?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Pick them off one by one like Venonat," replied Archer, scrutinizing the soldiers below through the scope of his gun. He directed Zoe's attention to them. "Watch this."</p>

<p>He aimed directly at the guard standing to the left and fired, killing him instantly. The second guard only had time to turn in confusion before Archer aimed at him too, striking his mark perfectly.</p>

<p>Noticing what had happened, the Lamball started bleating and waving its hooves as it hopped up and down frantically. A small group of other PIDF soldiers rushed out at the creature's alarm, and with a motion from Archer his waiting squadron of Team Rocket and Syndicate minions gave a war-cry as they sent out all their Pokémon to the attack.</p>

<p>Archer smirked to see the ensuing fray and hopped down from the cliff, keeping close to the trees. "While they're amassing their forces at the front, we sneak in the back, get the formula for the boss, and we all get out of here."</p>

<p>They hurried soundlessly to the edge of the fence and Archer motioned to the barbed wire. "Houndoom, melt that for us."</p>

<p>Houndoom sent forth a furry of embers towards the twisted metal strands. They melted down easily into smoldering liquid, and he glanced at Zoe.</p>

<p>Zoe had already sent out Pengullet, which at a motion from her shot its ice attack at the mass; the metal cooled instantly in a burst of steam. From there it was an easy matter to get over the fence and sneak in through the main entrance while the guards were trying to fend off the intruders in battle.</p>

<p>The lighting here was uniform and modern. As Archer proceeded swiftly down the path, Zoe and the Pokémon right beside him, he glanced up to see long, fluorescent lights had been placed on the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Looks like this is one of the few buildings on the island with electric power," he observed.</p>

<p>Zoe was worried about the minions they'd left outside. "Do you think our people will be able to hold up against Marcus' men?"</p>

<p>"They've all been well-trained. Besides, they're a distraction; they can bolt if they start losing the battle because they're not really trying to get in. Infiltrating is our job," Archer added, his blue eyes glittering.</p>

<p>They emerged to a vast room that was the factory. A number of large red oil tanks had been placed on either side of the room; Archer and Zoe quickly hid behind one of them to watch.</p>

<p>There were many people and animals alike here, gaunt figures that unquestionably kept their eyes down as they shuttled tumblestone, gold and crude oil from one end of the room to the other, forced to toil ceaselessly to blend them together.</p>

<p>They were gathering the first two items in a furnace, kindled by the fire type creatures, and producing solid bars that shimmered like platinum. A conveyor belt of some kind lay to the far side, feeding these ingots into a grinder. The fine shards were then blended with the crude oil, and the resultant mixture was being refined further, to at last produce sheets of a nondescript material that Archer surmised was the elusive plasteel.</p>

<p>Supervising the entire operation were many stern PIDF soldiers and a few Direhowl, which kept a firm watch on their captive laborers. Oppressive heat from the machinery and furnaces hung over the room, creating a worse sauna than that of the tropical sun outside, with a couple of large fans blowing the hot air around aimlessly in a pointless endeavor. A long table to the side held various Pal Spheres scattered across it, and was guarded by one of the soldiers. On the wall beside the table hung a long blade somewhere between a machete and a butcher's cleaver.</p>

<p>As far as the animals went, there were plenty of Lamball here, as well as several Lucario with coarse brown fur, Petilil adorned in lava instead of leaves, navy Espurr with a particularly jaded expression, Gogoat with berries trimming their grassy pelts, three-tailed Ninetales that looked partly crossed with Glaceon, and a few light-blue dragons Archer couldn't place but had the slim necks and delicate faces of Ampharos. <i>I'll probably figure out something better to compare them to if I think about it,</i> Archer thought.</p>

<p>"Anubis, Flambelle, Depresso, Caprity, Foxcicle, and Elphidran," Zoe rattled off the names with ease. "Some of these Pals are the ones the Syndicate gave to Marcus."</p>

<p>"Obviously the ones he deemed strong enough to spare from zapping in that Condenser thing," Archer replied. "Where do you think they've got the plasteel formula written down?"</p>

<p>He caught sight of a large window overlooking the factory from a height; it was one-way though, and he couldn't see what lay beyond it. <i>Maybe there's a monitoring station or private office behind that,</i> thought Archer, <i>That's probably going to be the likeliest place to look...</i></p>

<p>Archer heard a small gasp from Zoe, and he turned to see she had clasped a hand over her mouth and was gazing across the room. "All this time," she whispered, "I thought she was dead...!"</p>

<p>She pointed at a large cage they had to one side of the factory, which held a massive creature inside.</p>

<p>It was a giant Pikachu. Or at least, that was Archer's first notion of what it was; it was a bear as large as a Snorlax, with claws as long as a Zangoose, but it had the same short yellow fur and pointed, black-tipped ears of a Pikachu. Then again, maybe it was a closer relative of an Electabuzz. From this distance Archer couldn't be sure of that, though he could tell it looked disgruntled at being held in such tight quarters, to say nothing of hungry. The cage was wired to a electrical panel, evidently siphoning electricity from the Pokémon to use as a power source for the factory's electrical lighting and conveyor belt.</p>

<p>"It's my Grizzbolt," she said.</p>

<p>Archer considered the creature with skepticism. "Are you sure? I think that bear would just as soon eat us as it would be grateful if we let it out of there."</p>

<p>"Grizzbolt's a huge sweetheart," Zoe answered. "She wouldn't harm anyone unless I told her to. Those assholes, they've had her all this time and they've been mistreating her. I guess Marcus was lying about having thrown Grizzbolt in the condenser; instead he's using her here like a battery. We've got to get her out of there."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was shouting in the island language, and they glanced over. One of the animals carrying tumblestone had tripped from exhaustion and scattered its cargo across the floor.</p>

<p>At a directive from a guard, a Direhowl pounced to seize the unfortunate Lamball in its jaws and roughly hurled it against the wall, where it struck with a pained squeak. The Direhowl's trainer pulled the blade from the wall and slammed it down, embedding it on the table as a plain threat. The working creatures all cowered and even the people seemed to shrink back.</p>

<p>From their hiding place, Archer and Zoe observed.</p>

<p>"We should find a way to rescue these people, too," Zoe whispered.</p>

<p>Archer squinted. "Maybe your stolen Grizzbolt is one thing, but there's nothing we can do for the rest. We're here for one reason only – to find Giovanni's plasteel formula, not to liberate Marcus' prisoners. One of the first rules we have in Team Rocket is not letting your feelings get the better of you."</p>

<p>Even as he said this, he was silently evaluating the crowd. He observed one of the people at the conveyor belt who had been pulled aside by one of the guards, begging for their life.</p>

<p>The guard shouted some kind of abuse in response before pulling out one of the antique blue Poké Balls. As Archer watched, the prisoner was recalled to the capsule; the guard then walked over to the table, throwing one of the Pal Spheres there to the floor and sending out some other person to work instead. The new person didn't dare protest, immediately taking up the vacant spot.</p>

<p>Archer saw all this, and it was all he'd needed to see. Aversion and dark memories made his body tense, and in the same instant he forgot what he'd been saying but a moment ago and let his feelings get the better of him.</p>

<p>"Change of plans," he decided. "We're finding a way to rescue these people."</p><hr>

<p>From a private office that rose above the factory floor, Marcus could see everything that played out below if he so desired. A sprawling window overlooked the workplace, and an intercom system allowed orders to be given from here. For Marcus it was routine, though he usually left the onerous job of monitoring the plasteel manufacture to his subordinates.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Jett Silph, however, it was the first time she'd been here. Gazing down at the factory from where she stood at the window, she watched the human and animal captives at work with dismay. On her shoulder, Tanzee was munching on a berry, completely indifferent to any of it but happy to be back with its tamer.</p>

<p>"I can't possibly agree with this," said Jett, turning to Marcus. He was pouring out drinks for them both from a liquor decanter on his desk. "It's unneeded cruelty. Pokémon and humans were meant to have close bonds with each other and live in harmony."</p>

<p>"Exactly the same sentiment that makes me certain the average trainer living on your mainland regions would be easy pickings on Palpagos Island." Though Marcus shook his head with disapproval as he said this, it was spoken as an observation and not in a bad way. "You can't stomach the concept of survival."</p>

<p>"Survival? This is not about survival!" Jett exclaimed. "You told me you were recruiting help to work the factory, not that you were enslaving them!"</p>

<p>"So in your view, basic human rights should be upheld above all things?" Marcus lifted his eyebrows offering her a drink.</p>

<p>"Oh I don't care about the humans you have here," Jett scoffed, as she took the glass from him. "You can starve and shoot them at dawn for all I care. But those poor Pokémon...! What you're doing here makes <i>Team Rocket</i> look like good people. From what I understand, at least they're feeding the Pokémon working on their construction site back at their encampment."</p>

<p>"How do you think your late husband managed to produce at low cost?" Marcus countered. "You can have either cheap or humane. The Silph Company did not grow into a household brand by being humane, even if they were less than honest about where they sourced their materials from." His features contorted into a wry sort of smile. "Even in your world...it's survival of the fittest, darling."</p>

<p>Jett started to say something, but faltered. Her shoulders slumped, and she gazed at Marcus with resignation. "At least the Gogoat. I recognize those from the shuttle service in Lumiose; they're innocuous creatures."</p>

<p>"Gogoat...? Oh, the Caprity." His demeanor softened. "You'd like to remove them from the factory, I presume."</p>

<p>"If you could release them, I'd be so grateful."</p>

<p>"Very well," conceded Marcus, "I'll see to it they're released. You have my word they won't suffer here anymore."</p>

<p>Jett smiled with appreciation; she took a sip of her drink and laid it aside. "Then we come to the matter at hand. You still haven't paid me for the supply drops."</p>

<p>"Yes," conceded Marcus tentatively.</p>

<p>"...and you certainly never told me anything about the fact that <i>Team Rocket</i> was here."</p>

<p>Marcus pursed back a scowl. He hadn't wanted to tell her at all, but when her yacht arrived at Fisherman's Point and she was informed that his current office at the main settlement was no longer accessible, and therefore if she wanted to speak with him in person she'd have to visit the factory...it was enough to make her ask questions, and he wanted to avoid her learning the answers herself.</p>

<p>As soon as she'd arrived at the factory, he divulged the whole problem about the meddlesome castaway, who apparently was a Team Rocket agent all along, and who had brought his allies to overtake the island. Her features had blanched the moment he'd admitted that, and even now there remained a semblance of deep worry in Jett's eyes.</p>

<p>"They're brazen, coming here to try to take over our small, independent island when they have it all already," Marcus said to her, incensed. "We'll have to divert our attention from more important matters to fend them off."</p>

<p>"Fend them off? Don't tell me you've starting waging all out war against them."</p>

<p>"You don't expect me to relinquish my territory?"</p>

<p>Jett was more concerned about a different matter. "Stirring up a war against Team Rocket is having a death wish. I'm from the mainland, Marcus; I know firsthand. That's how my husband died."</p>

<p>"If the planetary council is so inept as I hear they are, then there shouldn't be that much of a concern."</p>

<p>"Taking on the planetary council is not the same as taking on Team Rocket," she said emphatically. "When I speak of the council I'm referring to people more entertained by the status quo. Team Rocket in contrast wants a monopoly, in anything and everything they do."</p>

<p>Marcus crossed his arms pensively as Jett went on:</p>

<p>"The council have established a precedent for mediocrity in the past few years. The leadership have their own views on how our world should be run. They're loathe to take outside opinion, and when they do they half-ass it to fit their own standards."</p>

<p>"Then I should think for that alone the mainland regions should be easy to take over."</p>

<p>She gave a complacent shrug. "The problem with the mainland, to be fair, is the population can't be appeased anyway. Everyone wants something different, everyone gets excited when the leadership announces something new, and when it fails to meet up to each person's imagination everyone comes together to complain about it. There's a strange sort of unity in that, anyway."</p>

<p>"Your mainland leaders want to pretend their world is a utopia," replied Marcus. "There is no utopia, not in the real world anyway."</p>

<p>Jett sighed. "As I've said, there should be no problem with attacking the mainland. So long as you start your invasion at the south-eastern side of Lumiose City."</p>

<p>"You're quite emphatic about that," he observed.</p>

<p>"It's the weakest point." She didn't elaborate. "But Team Rocket – that's another beast altogether."</p>

<p>Marcus shook his head slightly. "Don't worry about Team Rocket. I'll wrap things up here and as soon as my people can get the weaponry developed, I'll make sure our plans are placed back on target."</p>

<p>Recalling Tanzee to its Poké Ball, Jett opened another sphere to send out her Clefable. "That's acceptable. I really must be returning to the Kalos region. There's still a lot of work to be done on the land developments, and my absence would be noticed," she replied, and turned towards her Pokémon. "...Clefable, teleport us back to the dock at Fisherman's Point."</p>

<p>Clefable gave a cheery cry, and swung its paws to and fro; Marcus said nothing as both Jett and the fluffy pink Pokémon were whisked out of the office in a flash.</p>

<p>The moment they'd teleported away, however, he addressed one of the soldiers. "Tell the workers they'll have to double their labor. And inform the guards we'll be having a special dinner back at the town square tomorrow of herb-roasted Caprity."</p><hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Zoe was determined to get her Pokémon back; now that she saw it was alive there was no way she would just turn around and leave it.</p>

<p>She crept up to the cage. The electric type animal gave a small growl of recognition.</p>

<p>"It's me Grizzbolt," Zoe whispered. "Don't worry; I'll get you out."</p>

<p>Zoe picked at the lock as Archer and his Houndoom stood beside her as lookout. When she succeeded in opening it, Grizzbolt exited the cage putting its arms around her in a bear hug.</p>

<p>"Oh Grizzy, I've missed you too!" she said.</p>

<p>There was a shout, followed by Houndoom growling an alert, and they looked up to see a number of Marcus' soldiers running towards them. They had been discovered.</p>

<p>"Faint Attack," called Archer, and Houndoom leapt forward and tackled one of the enemy Direhowl. The two canines ended up in a snarling fight of fangs and fur.</p>

<p>"Get 'em, Grizzbolt!" Zoe shouted.</p>

<p>Grizzbolt roared, and slammed down its massive forepaws onto the ground. Electric arcs like lightning resonated outwards in a shock wave, bursting up from the ground to collide with their enemies.</p>

<p>A bolt of electricity fired sideways, striking the window of the monitoring platform headlong. Inside the office Marcus had to leap aside as the glass shattered completely.</p>

<p>The factory was cast into a tumult. Some of the prisoners seized the unexpected opportunity and struck out at the guards in a fight to snatch away weapons, and even the Pokémon working here now turned on their captors, snarling and unleashing their strongest attacks in a bid for freedom. Though weary and ill-fed, the thought of escape had an invigorating effect and bolstered the strength of sheer numbers.</p>

<p>Archer was contending with a number of enemies himself. He managed to shoot a couple of them but then his rifle ran out of bullets.</p>

<p>Unable to reload in time he turned about to club them with it; he hit one of the guards in the stomach but another punched Archer from the side and he stumbled, and in the ensuing fight the gun fell to the floor. Before he could retrieve it, one of the guards had grabbed the cleaver off the table and jumped at him. Archer found himself leaping back, trying both to evade the swordplay and find an opening to knock the weapon out of the soldier's grasp.</p>

<p>As the man lunged for him yet again, Archer succeeded in catching hold of his wrist. They fell backwards onto the conveyor belt, which proceeded uneventfully down the line as the two men fought.</p>

<p>They grappled viciously for the weapon, and Archer was about to steal it away when his enemy succeeded in wrenching his arm free and swung forcefully downward. Archer jerked aside; the cleaver slammed down on the conveyor belt inches away from his cheek.</p>

<p>His eyes then caught sight of what was coming down the line. They were moving towards a large entryway marked with faded yellow and black hazard stripes. Sharp blades rotated in the center like a blender on its side, whipping at high speed in a cyclone of steel and wind.</p>

<p>Archer's breath caught in his throat. "Oh shit—!"</p>

<p>He kicked his opponent hard, and was able to signal to Houndoom. The dog pounced with a snarl and sank its fangs into the enemy's arm, embers flickering at the edges of its mouth; the man cursed at the Pokémon loudly yet inadvertently loosened his grip on both Archer and the weapon.</p>

<p>Archer managed to snatch the cleaver away and tumble off the conveyor belt with Houndoom bolting after him, right as the soldier looked up. Realization flashed in his eyes but his shout was quickly torn apart, in both a figurative and literal sense; a warning indicator on the side of the contraption lit up in bright green.</p>

<p>As Archer sprang back to avoid getting soiled, the sound of beating wings and an overhanging shadow made him look up. Above, he saw Marcus riding on Faleris' back.</p>

<p>Marcus clicked his tongue in amusement. "First the essence condenser, now my disassembly conveyor? You have the most inventive ways of disposing of your enemies, even if they leave a frightful mess."</p>

<p>Archer didn't bat an eye. "Then I guess I'll see you in hell."</p>

<p>He hurled the cleaver in the air, straight towards Marcus. The blade hit against an energy barrier protecting him and fell anticlimactically to the ground.</p>

<p>Archer grimaced; he'd forgotten about the energy shield.</p>

<p>Marcus grinned smugly as he stared down at him. "I've got a better idea. Why don't I bring hell <i>here</i>?"</p>

<p>Faleris craned its neck back as Archer pulled Houndoom down beside him and they hit the ground as a blast of fire roared overhead, colliding with one of the red oil tanks across the room. A tremendous explosion rocked the factory floor, and an alarm began to blare as the massive iron doors began closing. Yells broke out from guards and prisoners alike caught in the blast.</p>

<p>Archer whipped around just as Marcus urged Faleris onward, hanging on tight as the giant hawk screeched and flew past in a streak of fire. The bird angled sideways to escape outside as the main doors slammed shut.</p>

<p>Archer snatched up the Poké Balls from the table and with Houndoom by his side, he raced to join Zoe with her Grizzbolt, and all of the other people and animals who were clustered at the blocked exit. They were desperately attempting to break out before the fire reached the rest of the crude oil tanks.</p>

<p>Try as they might, they were unable to force the doors open. Even many of Marcus' soldiers, forsaken by their leader to die with the prisoners, were trying to help to no avail.</p>

<p>"The damn doors are locked tight!" said Archer through gritted teeth. "If we don't get out soon, this whole place will blow up like fireworks."</p>

<p>"Maybe there's another exit?" Zoe proposed. Yet looking around the now decimated factory it was clear that there was only one way in or out, and it was the currently locked passageway.</p>

<p>The flames were carrying closer to the other oil tanks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Archer was thinking fast. "Remember what we did to cross the barbed wire?" he said. "We're going to do something like that...it's an old trick we've got in the Kanto region."</p>

<p>He motioned to Houndoom. "Hit that door with the strongest Inferno attack you can make," Archer told it, and the Pokémon howled affirmation before sending forth a wave of fire. As Houndoom let loose fire attack after fire attack, Archer turned to the lava-coated Flambelle standing in a cluster to the side.</p>

<p>"We need your help. We have to get this as hot as we can," Archer told them.</p>

<p>The Flambelle squeaked and hopped over to stand beside Houndoom, and soon all of the fire types present were attacking the door. Flame surged against the metal, till it was glowing red hot. Upon seeing this, Archer opened Frostallion's Poké Ball, and the ice type Pegasus emerged flapping its wings and neighing.</p>

<p>"Frostallion...and any ice or water types we've got here," he raised his voice, directing his attention to the crowd. "Use your ice attacks and aim right where the fire hit."</p>

<p>Frostallion reared back and unleashed a powerful ice beam. Zoe's Pengullet joined in, and the group of Foxcicle as well, blasting the door with ice and producing a cloud of steam.</p>

<p>When he heard the metal cracking, Archer felt a surge of elation, but a second explosion of an oil tank behind them made many of the animals leap up with startled cries and brought the urgency of the situation back to the forefront. "Now, Zoe, use your Grizzbolt to break this open," he urged.</p>

<p>"Grizzbolt, go!" yelled Zoe, as Grizzbolt gave a mighty roar, and slammed its whole body against the door. The metal creaked.</p>

<p>"Come on," muttered Archer, desperate. "It's got to have weakened enough by now..."</p>

<p>Grizzbolt hit against it again, and again. Finally there was a crash as the metal gave in and burst apart, allowing everyone to escape outside in a flood.</p>

<p>They ran for the forest's grassy slopes and when they were all at a distance, they saw the entire factory building explode in a ball of fire.</p>

<p>Archer led the squadron in cheers, and when the celebratory moment passed, Kris walked up to her brother, hugged him, and with a big smile on her face asked him:</p>

<p>"So Archer, let's see this formula we all practically risked our lives to get."</p>

<p>"Oh no," Archer said, growing pale, "Fuck!"</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Zoe asked as she joined them, "Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"The formula!" Archer exclaimed, "Zoe, do you have it?"</p>

<p>"No. I thought you had gotten it," Zoe admitted.</p>

<p>They all looked at the burning building that was practically reduced to nothing.</p>

<p>"All up in flames...gone," Kris said, "and the formula with it."</p>

<p>"How am I going to explain this to Giovanni?" Archer lamented.</p>

<p>No one knew the answer to that, so no one said anything. They stood there in silence watching what was left of the structure become a pile of ashes. At that moment one of the liberated prisoners came over.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," the man said speaking to Archer, "I was told you are in charge of this group?"</p>

<p>Archer nodded. "Yes," he confirmed, "My boss is Giovanni Delavita."</p>

<p>"Well, we just wanted to thank you...and your boss...for rescuing us," the man said, adding, "We'll never forget that you got us out of that hell hole."</p>

<p>"Good," Archer said, "Then if you're so appreciative, I want you to say it to my boss, so he'll understand how extremely difficult the whole process was. Maybe he won't be too angry we didn't get the secret formula."</p>

<p>"Secret formula?" the man asked.</p>

<p>"The secret formula for plasteel, which is used in the manufacture of the Master Ball and advanced weaponry," explained Zoe.</p>

<p>"We're so screwed," Archer mumbled.</p>

<p>The man heard him and answered, "Oh! Sir you have nothing to worry about, everyone held captive at the factory know the formula."</p>

<p>Archer, Zoe, and Kris all turned to look at the man directly, with surprised expressions plain on their faces.</p>

<p>"Are you kidding me?" Archer said, frowning, "Because if you are, let me tell you I'm in no mood for jokes right now."</p>

<p>"No joke," the man answered, "Dryden thought we would all die in captivity so he didn't keep the formula a secret, plus he had us all cross trained to do any chore needed...every week or so someone died so..."</p>

<p>"So he needed to be sure that everyone knew what they had to do," said a woman who had also been a prisoner.</p>

<p>Another prisoner joined in the conversation, adding, "We all knew a part of the process that was assigned to us, but we also were all aware of the entirety of the formula."</p>

<p>Archer smiled. "Well then," he said, "You will tell Giovanni, all of it."</p><h2>Chapter 20 - Rise of the Syndicate ✅</h2>

<p>When Archer, Zoe, and the rest of the squadron walked into the encampment with all the liberated prisoners, they found fainted Tocotoco strewn everywhere though the construction site was undamaged.</p>

<p>"Let me guess. Tocotoco raid?" Archer asked as soon as he saw Jessie and James.</p>

<p>"Exploding Xatu should fetch a fortune back home," Jessie said, tossing a Poké Ball at one of the birds. With the Tocotoco knocked out, the Poké Ball did not even shake, the indicator light merely flashing a few times before immediately registering the capture.</p>

<p>"No doubt. Any idea when the boss is going to ship out all the Pokémon we've caught?"</p>

<p>"He said he was shipping them out in batches of five," James answered, "starting tomorrow."</p>

<p>Jessie chimed in, "Opening the resort to tourists is on standby though, at least until the issue with Marcus is resolved..."</p>

<p>"One way or another," added Archer.</p>

<p>Meowth, meanwhile, had padded over to the large group of people and animals Archer had with him. "Looks like your squadron tripled in size," the cat yowled. "What is this, the whole factory workforce?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah. They all decided to walk out. Something about unsafe working conditions," Archer quipped.</p>

<p>"So long as they're not here to unionize the penguins we got finishing up our resort. The boss'll have a fit."</p>

<p>Archer waved the comment off. He turned to head on his way when he heard a moo and looked around to see a Mozzarina – the island's version of a Miltank – standing atop the newly finished annex to the hotel.</p>

<p>"Why is there a cow on the roof?" Archer ventured.</p>

<p>James shrugged. "It can't get down."</p>

<p>"It says it's hungry," added Meowth.</p>

<p>"How did it even get up there to begin with?"</p>

<p>"Chasing a squirrel."</p>

<p>"...never mind; screw this shit. Leave the cow there," Archer said, and steered the conversation elsewhere. "Where's Giovanni?"</p>

<p>"The boss is on the yacht." Jessie pointed towards the dock.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Archer, and motioning to his group to follow left the trio and their wayward bovine behind.</p>

<p>Archer directed the crowd to an area of the encampment where they could get food and water, and while they rested he headed towards the dock.</p>

<p>He found the Team Rocket don in his office aboard the ship; Archer knocked at the open door to announce himself, and was immediately waved in.</p>

<p>"Good news, I hope," said the leader of Team Rocket.</p>

<p>Archer looked down at his feet. He was ashamed that the mission hadn't gone completely as planned. Persian prowled around the perimeter of the office incessantly, its keen eyes locked on Archer. He could practically sense it judging him with the same disapproval he was sure would be reflected in its master's eyes; nevertheless he glanced back up and told Giovanni everything that had transpired.</p>

<p>"Well we don't really need the factory, most of the laborers probably wouldn't want to continue working in a place that was basically enslaving them," Giovanni said, after Archer finished the account, "We can build our own, bigger and better."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," Archer replied.</p>

<p>Giovanni got up from his seat, put his hands in his pockets and continued speaking:</p>

<p>"Since the people you rescued all know the formula and procedures for this endeavor, it stands to reason that we are keeping them to do most of the manual labor; of course we will treat them better than Marcus did...and also," Giovanni glanced at Archer adding, "they are aware of the expectation regarding complete loyalty to Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I did have a chat with them earlier," Archer informed him.</p>

<p>"And, are they willing to be reasonable and cooperative, or will we need to employ more persuasive methods to get them to talk?"</p>

<p>"They're volunteering the information," said Archer. "No need to beat them up."</p>

<p>"Good. All the better," Giovanni replied. "We won't have to waste time."</p>

<p>"Sir, they are getting something to eat," Archer informed him, "Would you wish to speak with them now?"</p>

<p>"A little later," Giovanni said and glanced at Archer. "At the moment, I have urgent business for you to tend to in the Kalos region."</p>

<p>"Kalos?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kalos. We were able to track down the originator of the supply drops from the starburst logo on the weaponry blueprints. Apparently, Marcus is getting his shipments from Quasartico Inc., the land development company based out of Lumiose City," Giovanni said. He had started pacing, as he did on occasion when he was analyzing something deeply. "Your mission is to find out who in the company is behind the supply drops and tell them on my behalf, that I now own Palpagos Island and those shipments to Marcus need to stop. If they decide to do business with Team Rocket at some point, that is another issue and we can discuss it at a later time."</p>

<p>"Sir...might I ask...what if they decline?" Archer saw Giovanni stop pacing and look at him directly, so he went on speaking, "Suppose whomever it is says they want to speak with Marcus first?"</p>

<p>"Nevermind about that," the boss replied, "just do as you're told. You will take Zoe with you...she is the link to the island and I'd like to know if she's ever seen the Quasartico person. When you finally speak with the person authorizing the drops, depending on what they say to you, will determine the next step Team Rocket will take."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"That group you've brought in must be finished eating and resting. Go get them and bring them here. Time they met their new boss." Giovanni said this and with a wave of his hand dismissed Archer, who quickly left the office.</p>

<p>Archer walked back across the beach, past the rooftop with the Mozzarina. He stopped briefly when he saw Jessie, James, and Meowth had pooled together a small cluster of minions to try to get a ladder up to the roof.</p>

<p>"Why don't you just recall it to its Poké Ball?" Archer asked them.</p>

<p>"It's not our cow," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Yet," added James.</p>

<p>Archer stared at them incredulously. "You mean it's wild? Then why not throw a Poké Ball and <i>make</i> it our cow already instead of fucking around with the ladder?"</p>

<p>"That's not as fun," James complained.</p>

<p>"Oh, whatever. Where's Zoe?"</p>

<p>"I think she's off speaking with some of the folks from her group," Jessie said, gesturing to point him in the right direction.</p>

<p>Meowth gave a pointed yowl as Archer was starting to walk away. "Why don't you just admit that you like Zoe? It's no damn secret, everybody notices the way you look after her...and for that matter she looks out for you too!"</p>

<p>Archer turned back alertly. "What?"</p>

<p>"Why don't ya just tell her you like her already and see what happens?" the cat purred. "It's not like it'd be a big deal; you're already married."</p>

<p>"Very funny. You know that marriage was a matter of convenience for both of us, and in my case I didn't even know I was getting hitched," Archer retorted. "At any rate it's a one-sided thing. She's the leader of her group here on Palpagos Island, and I'm returning to the Kanto region when we're done with our job."</p>

<p>"<i>Purrr</i>-lease. That won't be the last of it. Every time I see you twos, you remind me of Jessie and James."</p>

<p>"Is that supposed to be a compliment?" asked Archer dubiously. Yet Meowth had already turned his attention back to the Mozzarina, leaping up to the rooftop to apparently reason with the stubborn Pal; meanwhile, both Jessie and James had snickered in response but said nothing.</p>

<p>Archer did find Zoe near the tents, speaking with a group of people from the Syndicate. <i>I wonder what's going on?</i> he thought, lingering at a distance.</p>

<p>"That's stupid!" Zoe was exclaiming to the leader of the small group, a man of about forty years of age, "If you don't ask for Giovanni's permission he's going to say you're committing insubordination!"</p>

<p>The group leader rolled his eyes. "We are fully trained now and it is our island... Look, I get it... your alliance is now with your husband, and you're using that to try to step away from your role as Syndicate boss, but we don't have that link. Giovanni's not our boss."</p>

<p>"You're wrong. Very wrong," Zoe insisted, "Listen to me. I've been around them much more than you...they demand no less than complete loyalty, and when you've proven yourself they'll protect you forever, but if you go against them..."</p>

<p>"You're wasting our time," the leader interrupted her, "Let's go everyone."</p>

<p>He turned leaving quickly with the rest of his group following him. Zoe watched as they all marched out of the campsite and felt a sudden surge of stress flood over her.</p>

<p>"He's always been stubborn," Zoe heard a voice behind her and turned to see an elderly woman who was from her tribe. "Hawk is my grandson, and he's always had a different viewpoint about our culture and how we do things."</p>

<p>Zoe sighed, "But this isn't about culture, this is about survival. Team Rocket has very strict rules of engagement when it comes to internal affairs."</p>

<p>The old lady shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Zoe decided to tell someone what was happening; she walked quickly in the direction of Archer's tent but as she was less than halfway there she found him looking on at the conversations she had been having.</p>

<p>"Anything new?" Archer asked diplomatically.</p>

<p>"Archer! I was coming to see you. A group of the Syndicate, being led by Hawk, is heading off to the tower," she confessed, "their plan is to ambush and take it over from Marcus' people."</p>

<p>"I haven't been informed by Giovanni that he gave the go ahead for that," Archer said. "He usually tells me those type of things."</p>

<p>"That's the thing," Zoe replied, "They didn't ask him. Hawk took it upon himself to plan it and talked a few others into it. All the Syndicate is not involved but I worry they'll be giving the rest a bad name."</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said, taking her by the hand, "We'll go see Giovanni right now. Only those involved will have to answer to the consequences."</p><hr>

<p>When Giovanni was informed of what was happening he was not pleased; in fact he was very angry. On the boss' orders, Archer organized Team Rocket soldiers into two squadrons to bring back Hawk's group. Archer mounted Frostallion, while Zoe rode alongside him on Grizzbolt's back, and they led the way out of the camp.</p>

<p>They could see the Syndicate's tower with its glowing I insignia before they even neared it, the tall skyscraper relic standing sentinel over the island. Archer, Zoe, and their group reached a rise overlooking the clearing at the base of the tower, where they could see the rogue squadron that, having gotten there first, had immediately engaged with the enemy. A battle was already raging, with trainers and Pokémon alike embroiled in combat and little heed paid as to whether one's opponent was man or beast.</p>

<p>"Looks like they're losing big-time," commented one of the Team Rocket minions.</p>

<p>"Yeah well Giovanni didn't send us here to be their backup." Archer searched the violence-ravaged scene. "Do any of you see Hawk?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There he is!" yelled Zoe as she pointed him out with a couple of his men running away from the tower entrance.</p>

<p>Archer urged Frostallion forward, to fly down and land beside Hawk barring his way. Zoe joined him, her Grizzbolt's massive figure blocking off his other side.</p>

<p>Archer snapped at Hawk, "No one gave you authorization for this."</p>

<p>"We don't need authorization to reclaim what's ours," Hawk countered.</p>

<p>"Your orders are to abandon this fight at once," Zoe said. "You're being given the chance to do so willingly as a courtesy."</p>

<p>Hawk didn't respond, except to dart unexpectedly past Frostallion and race back to his ranks. Before Archer could order his Pokémon to attack them or order his squadrons on the hill likewise, the Unowns suddenly appeared.</p>

<p>They swirled around near Archer and Zoe and spelled out a word:</p>

<p>RUN</p>

<p>Archer's eyes quickly darted from the Unown to the tower, and to the flicker of motion and green feathers lingering near the bushes at the entrance.</p>

<p>He focused on the lone Tocotoco there, which was observing the fighting blankly, and his stomach plummeted with realization.</p>

<p>
  <i>Where's the rest of the...oh shit.</i>
</p>

<p>"Run for it!" Archer exclaimed, right as several Selfdestruct explosions sounded, one after the other; a splinter of light shuddered up the length of the building, like the vertical leap of a Raikou, and just as suddenly the whole pillar came straight down.</p>

<p>Stones fell like a deadly hailstorm, and with it an oppressive cloud of dust. Everyone immediately turned to flee for their lives. Those Pokémon too small to carry their trainers brought forth glittering Protect barriers to shield them, while the rest tried to outrun or outfly the blast.</p>

<p>The tower had exploded. A bunch of Tocotoco birds had flown into it, or...had someone sent them in?</p>

<p>The Unown were flitting around and chirping, upset their tower had been decimated. They organized themselves to spell out the word DISASTER.</p>

<p>"They used that flock of Tocotoco like an implode unit," Archer grumbled. "Those bastards didn't give a fuck the building would come crashing down on their Pokémon."</p>

<p>From Archer, spite over this was perhaps an unexpected emotion. He had little affection for those exploding dodo birds, yet it still seemed unnecessary to capture a whole flock for this when the PIDF could just as easily have put conventional explosives, if destroying the tower was what they'd intended to accomplish. Or maybe it was the careless simplicity of how they threw away the lives of their servants.</p>

<p>Zoe meanwhile was staring at the vestiges of her family's heritage, the once imposing skyscraper now a forlornly crumbled pile of rocks and debris with a mist of ash still lingering in the air like a shroud.</p>

<p>"This tower had always been important to us," Zoe lamented, "so treasured by us that we protected it with our lives. It was a landmark here on our island for over a century. In little more than a minute, it's gone."</p>

<p><i>The folly of becoming attached to real estate,</i> Archer thought, but he wouldn't have ever said so. He felt bad for Zoe; he could see how much it had meant to her, and he came over to stand by her as she gazed sadly at the rubble.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Giovanni will want it rebuilt," said Archer. "It'll be even grander, you'll see."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but it won't be the same," Zoe said, a bit hoarsely. She looked up at the rogue squadron standing by mutely, as well as their commander Hawk, and her hands tightened into fists.</p>

<p>"If you had followed orders," she told them bitterly, "if you had played by the rules... we would have planned for the enemy's every possible maneuver and avoided this! That tower was everything to our people; it was the symbol of what Dryden's regime took from this island, and if you'd only worked alongside Team Rocket instead of becoming as egotistic as a Penking this wouldn't have happened. It's your fault the tower was destroyed!"</p>

<p>"Better demolished than gifted away," Hawk responded, "Why else would we have sent those Tocotoco in?"</p>

<p>The world hushed, for none more than Zoe. She stared at him, only stared.</p>

<p>Hawk went on, as arrogant as ever. "It's time for a new rise of our Syndicate, which you're not going to bring. We've lived on this island for generations. Everyone knows the tower belonged to us – and only us! And you, a direct lineage of the Rayne family...you would have given it to the outsiders—"</p>

<p>"What outsiders?" Zoe retorted, cutting him off short. "The Syndicate and Team Rocket are the same! We <i>always were the same</i>!"</p>

<p>The ferocity in her voice stunned Hawk into immobility. Zoe's amethyst eyes now burned with violet fire no one had ever seen till that day, a transformation that shocked them all, especially when she whipped out a pistol and shot Hawk point-blank in his forehead.</p>

<p>He fell to the ground, dead. Zoe turned her fiery glare and the pistol on the rest of the squadron, and they all flinched back in anticipation. Archer, standing aside, hid a small smile.</p>

<p>"Is anyone else confused about their loyalties?" demanded Zoe.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," one replied, having recovered his words, "you are the heiress of the Rayne Syndicate. You are our boss."</p>

<p>"No," she specified, dryly, "your boss is Giovanni Delavita."</p><hr>

<p>Team Rocket marched their five prisoners back to the encampment and straight to the boss' office aboard the yacht.</p>

<p>In the office, alongside Giovanni, were his trusted guards James and Jessie together with Meowth. Archer and Zoe both saluted and as soon as the prisoners were placed before Giovanni, the other guards and their Pokémon who'd come with them exited.</p>

<p>"Report," Giovanni commanded.</p>

<p>"Sir," Archer began, "these are the traitors who went on the mission without your consent. Their leader, one called Hawk, is dead. Hawk destroyed the tower by way of Tocotoco explosion. It is in total ruins."</p>

<p>"Who eliminated the traitorous leader?" Giovanni asked.</p>

<p>"Zoe did so sir, and emphasized to these prisoners that you are their leader."</p>

<p>"Zoe, step forward," ordered the boss of Team Rocket.</p>

<p>Zoe took a step closer to Giovanni's desk. Her countenance was resolute and her demeanor courageous. "Tell me Zoe," Giovanni asked, "What prompted you to take action on behalf of Team Rocket's honor?"</p>

<p>"Sir, it's thanks to Team Rocket and your leadership that this island and its people are being liberated," she replied. "I want to be part of the new Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>Giovanni nodded his head approvingly. "You are a part of Team Rocket and have proven yourself to me."</p>

<p>The boss of Team Rocket then turned his attention on the five rogue Syndicate members before him. One of them opted to speak.</p>

<p>"If you want to know why we did what we did, it was only because..." began one of the prisoners.</p>

<p>Giovanni cut him off short.</p>

<p>"James," he said sharply, and the Team Rocket admin stepped to Giovanni's side at attention, "Explain to this dimwit what is wrong with his manner of address."</p>

<p>"He has not spoken with respect," James replied promptly. "He failed to refer to you as Mr. Delavita or Sir."</p>

<p>"Correct," said Giovanni, icily turning towards the now fidgeting prisoner. "Would you care to try again?"</p>

<p>The prisoner turned pale, then spoke again. "Sir... We were all following Hawk...who claimed he could lead our Syndicate best...he assured us that we had a right to do what we did, and we are all proud of our island, but..." He stopped here and swallowed hard then went on. "It seems we have offended you and for that I speak for all of us... we apologize sincerely."</p>

<p>"I accept your apology," replied Giovanni, "nonetheless, the fact remains that you all disobeyed orders. There will have to be punishment for this."</p>

<p>He turned towards his trio of guards. "James, Jessie, Meowth." As he called their names, they quickly stood before him and saluted.</p>

<p>"Take these prisoners to the camp center and execute them. Announce that by my order, this be an example of what happens when some decides to get out of line without my express permission."</p>

<p>The prisoners' eyes widened with incredulous fear, and the one who'd been speaking before now blurted out, "You can't do this...!"</p>

<p>Giovanni smirked. "This is my island. I can do whatever I want."</p>

<p>James and Jessie surrounded the five prisoners and ushered them out of the office at gunpoint, with Meowth growling a warning in case one of them should try to flee.</p>

<p>The procession towards the center of the campsite was a new sight to the Syndicate people. When they saw a group of their own being handled as prisoners, many became afraid. That however, was part of Giovanni's plan. The boss of Team Rocket wanted to make this execution as public as possible to scare the new recruits of Team Rocket to the point that they would not even consider turning against them.</p>

<p>The whole thing was very fast. The prisoners were lined up against a wall that belonged to the hotel building they were constructing. Shots rang out and were heard for at least two miles in the surrounding area.</p><hr>

<p>Every time Jett had visited Palpagos Island in the past had been calm and uneventful, and if the island had not been so primitive and underdeveloped she might have even considered it a good spot for a holiday.</p>

<p>This time was a little different. Jett remained inside her yacht and only gingerly peered out of the windows, concerned about Team Rocket seeing her. She told herself she had nothing to be afraid of; Team Rocket's conflict was with Marcus, not her.</p>

<p>She glanced over at the three Pokémon she had aboard ship with her: Pansage, Clefable, and Furfrou. Her Pokémon, at least, gave a distraction from her numerous worries.</p>

<p>"So Pansage, or is it Tanzee? ...You seem to prefer the name Tanzee now, I see," she observed, as the monkey cackled and swung about with its tail.</p>

<p>"All right, you can be Tanzee for now. It's only for a little while longer anyway," Jett added, "I'm buying the finest Leaf Stone from the boutique back home so you can evolve into a Simisage."</p>

<p>The monkey hopped up and down shrieking gleefully; if it liked the name Tanzee, it evidently liked the idea of evolving even better.</p>

<p>In the midst of this there was the sound of beating wings, and she saw a shadow descend beyond the window. She pulled back the drapes to see Marcus stepping down from Faleris and recalling the bird to its capsule.</p>

<p>He looked somewhat dishevelled, and obviously exhausted. He no sooner stepped into where she and her Pokémon were waiting than Jett exclaimed, "Marcus! What happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Team Rocket made another unannounced appearance," he divulged. "They burnt my factory to the ground."</p>

<p>Jett went pale. "Had I stayed there but a little longer, they would have seen me. ...I need to get back to Lumiose as quick as I can."</p>

<p>"You do that," said Marcus, "I'll be hard to reach for a few days, at least till I can gather my forces and assemble the weapons we need to invade Lumiose."</p>

<p>"You already said the factory was burnt to the ground."</p>

<p>"I never said I would be the one to assemble them," Marcus replied. "If my hunch is right, Giovanni won't resist being able to make those weapons for himself. He already has the first set of schematics his people stole from us."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?" Jett said vehemently. "Then he'll have both the island <i>and</i> the weapons."</p>

<p>"Not if I play my cards right," said Marcus grimly. "I've got a secret weapon in play that'll put them all to shame."</p>

<p>Jett studied him blankly and he thought he may have spoken too much, however he soon realized that she hadn't interpreted the remark correctly when she said, "I know your Faleris is a high level, but I think you might be overestimating your Pokémon's attack strength just a little bit. Team Rocket owns at least a couple of legendaries, from what I am told."</p>

<p>"Faleris' attack power rivals Legendary Pals," Marcus replied, deciding to uphold the ruse, "and it's a naturally fast flier as well. Anyway, I'll find a method to contact you as soon as I can."</p>

<p>With that, he bid farewell and left the yacht, and Jett departed for the Kalos region soon afterwards. She was starting to regret her little plan for Lumiose; if Marcus was having these constant setbacks, and now Team Rocket was getting involved, then maybe trying to get those buildings on the south-eastern side of Lumiose forcibly demolished was becoming more trouble than it was worth. She already had the urban redevelopment contracts. Maybe she was asking for too much.</p>

<p>No one from Team Rocket saw the ship sailing away.</p><h2>Chapter 21 - Lumiose City ✅</h2>

<p>Archer watched the forest landscapes run swiftly by as the train made its way towards Lumiose City, with Zoe sitting in front of him and her pet Pengullet perched cheerfully on her lap.</p>

<p>Giovanni had sent them both on this mission, and Archer would never even entertain the travesty of disobeying his godfather. However, out of all the mainland regions he'd visited, the one Archer had always liked least was Kalos.</p>

<p>Kalos was beautiful in its landscapes, but it was a tailored beauty of meticulous gardens and baroque mansions, and the people, while charming and cultured, mostly upheld a kind of politics that basked in what was – at least in Archer's view – blatant hypocrisy. Then again Kalos had its own vibes; different vibes, compared to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Over in Kanto there was an air of exploration, of going into the ferns and woods right outside the cities and seeing what you could find, and coming back either with three or four Rattata or tales of some scary beast lurking in the shallows off the Cinnabar coastline. In Johto it was similar, with the exception of cities being more traditional in their style, and the people bearing legends vague enough to carry the allure of untold mysteries hidden in some forgotten cavern – and you'd certainly find <i>something</i> if you pried around those pitch-black caves, though it probably wouldn't answer your questions.</p>

<p>Hoenn had secrets behind every rock and bush, it seemed, though no one really spoke about them, being too enamoured with the sea and the sun; and Sinnoh, well, Archer honestly hadn't been much to Sinnoh, but everyone he'd met who had spent some time there spoke of the region like it was just as marvelous as Johto. Unova was modern but still held mysteries and places to explore, although you probably wouldn't find anything worthwhile there unless it wanted to be found; however, bustling Castelia City and their famous ice cream parlor more than made up for it.</p>

<p>Orre meanwhile was his kind of place, sinister and practical, with money upheld as a strict priority among the inhabitants, all of whom were sly enough to keep up appearances unless you deliberately went looking for trouble. Hidden as oases in its forbidding deserts lay some of the most beautiful landscapes and impressive stadiums Archer had seen in his life; it was a shame few tourists went there, yet the few who did all spoke longingly of a return.</p>

<p>He was also aware of other regions too, countless others he hadn't yet visited for one reason or another, but which surely each held their own charm. He knew from Jessie and James about Galar, though from what they recounted it was a straightforward place with little wonder, and beautiful wild areas occasionally marred by scrawny trees. Business in Wyndon was always thriving and drew you in magnetically, but an average trainer without investments or holdings there might've felt like they were missing out on something.</p>

<p>Then there was Palpagos Island, which he wanted to view with disdain but couldn't anymore. It was as practical as Orre and as openly explored as Kanto, with the untold mysteries of Johto and the tropical sea and sun of Hoenn one could be enamoured by at a glance. How could he despise a place that reflected everything he loved about home? All it was missing was a big city, and Team Rocket would build a city themselves.</p>

<p>But Kalos was going to be Zoe's introduction to the mainland. And as they stepped off the train and into the city, Archer was silently puzzling over the task ahead. He wanted to show her all that was wonderful about the mainland, a feat he imagined would be challenging here.</p>

<p>To his surprise, it turned out to be exceptionally easy.</p>

<p>"You can buy <i>bread</i>?!"</p>

<p>Archer looked at her blankly for a moment. "...yes?"</p>

<p>"But you don't understand, on the island you have to bake bread yourself! ...and that could take hours of your day! You mean here there's actually a merchant who devotes his entire business to baking bread and selling it to people?"</p>

<p>"That is a bakery."</p>

<p>"You have a name for it, too?!"</p>

<p>Maybe Kalos was going to be interesting this time around. One could hope.</p>

<p>The myriad trappings of modern life, which Archer saw as commonplace, were a source of fascination for Zoe. He'd seen her awe when Team Rocket first arrived on Palpagos Island, yet somehow he'd underestimated just how behind in contemporary knowledge the island people were. They knew of electric power and the like, but they commonly accepted that electrical appliances and technology were reserved only for the government in power or anyone clever enough to get their hands on it. With the way Archer had extolled the Team Rocket organization, Zoe could have been forgiven for believing Giovanni to be a king of some sort on the mainland and hence had his island encampment equipped accordingly.</p>

<p>To see such marvels now as streets filled with cars and well-stocked stores with central air conditioning and even automatic sliding doors – the latter amazed her enormously, for some reason – and that it was all available for the masses, was more than enough for Zoe to declare that the mainland was a jewel and screw Marcus for having kept all this from the islanders for so long.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps it was hard to hide his lacklustre regard for Kalos, because at some point as they were strolling down the sidewalk Zoe remarked:</p>

<p>"This isn't your favorite place, is it." She second-guessed herself almost instantly, and backpedalled, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry."</p>

<p>"No, it's not bad memories or anything like that," Archer replied. "Honestly it's politics. Kalos is a mess."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>He tried to distract the conversation elsewhere yet she was relentless.</p>

<p>"Come on, now I'm curious. How is Kalos a mess?"</p>

<p>"The people here have strange ideas, that's all." Archer said. "To start with bureaucracy is rampant... Taxes for everything are such highway robbery it puts many of our Team Rocket extortion schemes to shame...They have the wild idea that there's an additional elemental type called fairy, and that they need to reclassify Jigglypuff because of it. Colress says it causes a fuss whenever the debate is brought up at scientific conventions..."</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous. Everyone knows there are only nine types," Zoe interjected.</p>

<p>"...seventeen types," Archer corrected.</p>

<p>Zoe dismissed it with a wave. "It's all good."</p>

<p>"They also believe an ancient myth about something called mega evolution. As if Pokémon can evolve temporarily and then revert to their old forms afterward."</p>

<p>"Wait – that sounds kind of neat. So a Sparkit...sorry, a Pikachu, can switch to a Raichu and then go back to being a Pikachu?"</p>

<p>"No. More like a Venusaur will grow more leaves in battle and then shed them afterwards. It's stupid."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's stupid. I still think it sounds kind of neat."</p>

<p>Archer would prefer the simplicity of Kanto and Johto, where they didn't trifle so much with what he viewed as frivolous gimmicks, and where any strange and fascinating ability was a mythological tale left to the Legendary Pokémon.</p>

<p>But he still hadn't told her the worst of it, or what he saw as the worst...</p>

<p>"They had an uprising here a few years back, though it never got as far as the Plasma War in the Unova region."</p>

<p>This piqued her interest. "Oh? What was it about?"</p>

<p>"...are you sure you want to hear it? Kalos is a mess."</p>

<p>"It can't be that bad."</p>

<p>Archer decided to indulge her with the tale. "This guy here in Kalos took one look at the war happening over in Unova and decided to destroy the world."</p>

<p>"...why?"</p>

<p>"He said it wasn't beautiful enough."</p>

<p>Zoe stared at him quizzically.</p>

<p>"The world, not the war," Archer specified. "There's probably no way to have a beautiful war."</p>

<p>"Okay..."</p>

<p>"So he kidnapped a condor and a deer and tried to use them to power a mythical weapon to nearly annihilate half the region. That shit didn't work out so he figured, the next best thing would be using this weapon to somehow give himself immortality."</p>

<p>"So he could live in the ugly world?"</p>

<p>"A bunch of teenagers show up to tell him it was a bad idea because apparently they'd read a history book and discovered his long-lost ancestor tried something similar once upon a time and it didn't go well, but the other guy basically said 'fuck you, I'll do it anyway' ...at which point he fired off the weapon only for his whole underground bunker to come crashing down on his head," Archer recounted, entirely deadpan. "Somehow he survived because the deer <i>did</i> increase his life span but the condor got pissed and fucked up his looks. The last I heard he and his buddies now run a food truck somewhere on the south side of Lumiose. Damned expensive food, too."</p>

<p>"Is this for real?" Zoe asked in disbelief.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately so."</p>

<p>"Kalos is a mess."</p>

<p>A third voice chimed in. "Kalos has its own kind of beauty. A nostalgic sort, maybe, but it is there."</p>

<p>"Taunie! Good to see you!" Archer greeted, as the newcomer joined them.</p>

<p>Taunie was the youngest of Giovanni's godchildren, and knew Archer from family gatherings. Blonde hair tipped with red highlights accentuated a face with soft features and large blue eyes. She had a Pokémon with her, a Totodile.</p>

<p>"What brings you to these parts, Archer?" Taunie asked as she and Archer hugged hello.</p>

<p>"We're here on business," Archer replied, "but I figured we could spend the first day sightseeing. It's Zoe's first time in Kalos." He turned to Zoe and explained, "Taunie and I have the same godfather, Giovanni. We've known each other all our lives, because Giovanni has gatherings often where he reunites all his godchildren. As far as we're concerned, we're all kinfolk."</p>

<p>Taunie stuck her hand out for Zoe to shake, which she did. "Nice to meet you Zoe." She then said to Archer, "you know you probably have time to show her around a bit."</p>

<p>While true, there was more to their tourist holiday than merely showing Zoe around. He wasn't very sure where to begin as far as figuring out who in Quasartico Inc. was Marcus' business associate. Having a day to get settled in would give him a chance to properly plan their strategy.</p>

<p>"Taunie we wouldn't mind if you were to tag along," Archer said.</p>

<p>"I'm fascinated by everything I've seen so far," Zoe added.</p>

<p>"Okay!" exclaimed Taunie, "Guess you've got yourself an extra tour guide. First though, I think we should find a place to eat...get energized for the walk about."</p>

<p>Taunie's Totodile growled happily at the thought of food and hopped up and down with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>They stopped at a local café to have some of the city's famous croissants and galettes, then afterwards went about to some of the most well-known tourist locations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Prism Tower was closed, with a wall encircling the property while construction crews finished up renovations on the façade, which left them to admire the iconic building from afar.</p>

<p>Then Taunie showed Zoe the mall, whereupon they spent close to three hours looking though clothes and perfumes and pretty things, a shopping spree which no doubt made up in Zoe's mind for Kalos otherwise being an egregious mess, and which Archer eventually got bored with and went off to see if he could pick a fight with some other Pokémon trainer in the plaza.</p>

<p>Taunie stopped him, awkwardly apologetic. "Pokémon battles are outlawed in Lumiose City by day."</p>

<p>"Come again?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>"You can only hold them on designated battlefields or at night in the special tournament they're going to be holding called the Z-A Royale," she explained.</p>

<p>"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. What is our world coming to?" Archer complained.</p>

<p>"The city council said something about keeping Lumiose safe for passersby and avoiding people loitering around as bystanders."</p>

<p>"There must've been some hell of collateral damage that happened for Lumiose's municipal government to enact such a dumb law. What, did a kid get hit by a rogue Hyper Beam or something?"</p>

<p>"There was a rash of Pokémon thefts a couple of years back where trainers would get jumped in alleyways after battle for their Poké Balls."</p>

<p>Archer remained unimpressed. "That's just doubly dumb. What kind of trainers hang out in alleys without a Pokémon by their side, out of its Poké Ball for protection?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be of any help anyway," Taunie replied, "It's illegal to have your Pokémon target a person in Lumiose City even if it's supposedly in self defense."</p>

<p>Archer spent the rest of the outing muttering obscenities about Lumiose having too much government and misusing taxes, longing to be in Johto or Unova or even – heaven forbid – Palpagos Island. Despite how much he'd clamored to get off that damned island with its knock-off species, up to a point its ways reminded him more of old-fashioned common sense than Kalos ever could.</p>

<p>He cheered up considerably when, after passing the fifth poster advertising the coming Z-A Royale tournament, he inquired after the rules.</p>

<p>"You mean to say we can sneak up and ambush opponent Pokémon to gain the advantage?" Archer could hardly believe his ears. "This isn't a one-off thing; this is actually expected and part of the rules?"</p>

<p>"Yep," Taunie affirmed, "you have to lurk around the shadows in the streets cordoned off for the event to spring attacks on other competitors before they hit your Pokémon first."</p>

<p>"I like that. I'm entering the tournament."</p>

<p>Suddenly a bunch of the Unowns surrounded them. They squeaked at Archer, and one of them poked his arm in a hello.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," Archer greeted them nonchalantly, "I didn't expect you to show up here in the Kalos region. You get around."</p>

<p>"Are those Unowns?" Taunie took a wary step backward, "I've heard they can be unpredictable in groups."</p>

<p>"Don't worry. The only one they want to pester is me." Archer turned back to the Unowns. "What've you got for us?"</p>

<p>Rotating their positions, the Unown spelled:</p>

<p>PLANTS</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>COME SEE</p>

<p>The Unown led Archer, and consequently Zoe and Taunie, to one of the stretches of parkland in the city – a miniature route of sorts that was marked by a translucent green energy barrier. A sign in front invited trainers in, and labelled the area: <i>Lumiose Wild Zones, Quadrant 9</i>.</p>

<p>"Wild zones?" Archer glanced quizzically at Taunie.</p>

<p>"They're part of the urban redevelopment project Quasartico is doing," Taunie explained. "They're parks throughout the city for wild Pokémon."</p>

<p>Archer immediately took interest when she mentioned it was a Quasartico backed development. "We're going to follow the Unown in and see what's up. We'll catch up to you later, Taunie."</p>

<p>With the Unown in the lead, Archer and Zoe entered the park. A meandering walkway cut a trail through grassy fields and overlooked pristine manmade ponds. Despite this, it felt small. The buildings formed a canyon around the wild zone, yet it was remarkable how many species of Pokémon Archer observed in the same site.</p>

<p><i>They must have trucked them in,</i> he reasoned, unable to imagine such a large diversity of species deciding to move into the city of their own accord. He spied everything from wild Pikachu scampering into the tall grass to Slowpoke fishing for Shellder at the pond.</p>

<p>They brought them to a flowerbed where dozens of exotic red flowers were planted. Here, the Unowns halted, and once again spelled out the word:</p>

<p>PLANTS</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you're right," said Archer, bored, "those are plants."</p>

<p>"Wait," exclaimed Zoe, "those are the same plants from our island."</p>

<p>Archer gave them a second look. She was right; he recognized the flowers with their dewy vines as the same strange variety that had grown wild in the abandoned city on Astral Mountains.</p>

<p>The only place those flowers could have come from was Palpagos Island.</p>

<p>One of the Unown trilled as if calling to someone, whereupon a new Pokémon tentatively emerged from the bracken to stand before Archer and Zoe.</p>

<p>It was a little green Pokémon with a big hexagonal red spot and a single eye, almost formless in shape, but about the same size as the Unown. It chirped, and was joined by several others which crawled out from underneath the bushes. All of them seemed to respond to the first, which was the only one to have a spot. Archer guessed it was the leader.</p>

<p>"What the hell are these?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Unowns reorganized their positions and answered:</p>

<p>COUSINS</p>

<p>Archer eyed the cluster of new creatures dubiously; Zoe opened a Pokédex she'd been gifted by Team Rocket, back on the island, and pointed it at them.</p>

<p>
  <i>Zygarde<br />
Type: Dragon-Ground<br />
It's hypothesized that this Pokémon monitors the ecosystem from deep in the cave where it lives. If its habitat falls into disarray, it reveals its secret power.</i>
</p>

<p>"So it's a regional form of Unown," Archer decided.</p>

<p>"No, it's a Zygarde," Zoe corrected.</p>

<p>Archer was unimpressed. "It's got one eye and they hang out in groups. It's a regional form of Unown. We'd best be wary of them."</p>

<p>Zoe was studying the information displayed on the Pokédex. "If this says Zygarde live in caves, how come these are here in the middle of the park?"</p>

<p>"Unown live in old ruins, and they routinely come out to raise havoc," said Archer with a glance at the Unown, one of which gave a squeak attesting to it.</p>

<p>"Somehow I don't think that these other Pals are out here because they want to be," Zoe said.</p>

<p>Several of the Zygarde looked annoyed, and the leader chirped a couple of times. The Unown replied to it with squeaks, and then turned around to address the humans again.</p>

<p>PLANTS BAD EAT</p>

<p>"These plants weren't put there to eat," Archer said, "they were put there as ornamentation. Did one of you get indigested?"</p>

<p>The lead Zygarde gave a series of chirps that was obviously a long-winded account of the happenings, though of course neither Archer nor Zoe could comprehend it. Suddenly, it stood up straight as if it had sensed something, and gave a shrill sound to the others. All the Zygarde scattered.</p>

<p>The Unown also seemed to have detected something, and squeaking over each other in unison circled around and teleported away without explanation.</p>

<p>Before either Archer or Zoe could react, there was the howl of an animal and a loud crashing sound of an attack being fired. A large white-furred Pokémon bounded into view, trying to shake sap and vines away from its muzzle.</p>

<p>Archer recognized the creature as an Absol. The fur on its ruff had bristled and fluffed out to nearly triple its size, like flared wings, and its fangs were longer than usual and bared furiously.</p>

<p>A <i>winged Absol</i>. Archer had never seen a winged Absol. For a moment he thought he was back on the island with its familiar-yet-distinct wildlife.</p>

<p>"What kind of Absol has..."</p>

<p>He didn't have time to say another word before the Absol swung its head, and a scythe of violet energy spun outwards towards them. Archer and Zoe hit the ground as it narrowly missed and collided with a lamppost behind where they stood. The light crashed to the ground.</p>

<p>"Houndoom, come out!" Archer called, as he grabbed the Poké Ball from his pocket and swiftly pressed the button to open it.</p>

<p>Houndoom sprang forth in glistening light, and immediately turned its attention on their aggressor. It leapt to sink its fangs into Absol's shoulder; Absol countered by raking its claws across Houndoom's flank, and both Pokémon tumbled backwards into the flowers.</p>

<p>Sap from the flowers was now streaked across Houndoom's pelt as well. Houndoom snarled, yet its growl had become fiercer and more guttural, and suddenly its fur began to glow almost as if it were evolving.</p>

<p>The light held an almost magenta sheen; if this was an evolution, it was unlike any other. Houndoom's stature grew till it was almost the same height as its opponent, the horns on its head straightened upwards, the ridge around its shoulders lengthened till its swept outwards like a shield of bone, and its claws and the tip of its tail began to shine a bright red-orange as if dipped in lava...</p>

<p>Archer couldn't believe it. He stared in shock at the dog, not sure whether he should call it back into its Poké Ball or try to stop the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>"Did Houndoom evolve?" Zoe questioned, glancing at Archer with wonderment.</p>

<p>"Houndoom <i>aren't able</i> to evolve," he emphasized.</p>

<p>With a howl, Houndoom sprang viciously at Absol again, which shrieked and raced out of the park towards the city streets.</p>

<p>Houndoom ran after Absol with a vengeance, and Archer grabbed Zoe's hand as they chased after the two Pokémon.</p><hr>

<p>A block away, there was a crowd gathered where the city mayor was making a speech proclaiming the opening of the last of the city's planned wild zones. Mrs. Jett Silph was also present, along with her security guard Mr. Muscat, and as the mayor finished his speech he turned towards Jett. "...the CEO of Quasartico Inc. Would you like to say a few words?"</p>

<p>Jett smiled, and obliged. She spoke a bit about the beautiful new parks, and how they would bring in plenty of tourism, which was mostly a restatement of what the mayor had already said; however the eloquence of how their renewed city would cultivate the bonds between mankind and nature – that was all hers.</p>

<p>"Our development is not just for aesthetics. It's a step towards the future, a step towards making Lumiose a city for everyone," Jett declared, spreading her arms wide for emphasis. "A city for people and Pokémon, together..."</p>

<p>Her voice was drowned out by an explosion, somewhere from behind her. Jett hardly had a chance to turn round to see what it was before the crowd was flung into a panic and everybody scattered.</p>

<p>Jett caught sight of the flash of white fur and the spark of a rising energy attack before the full image came into focus: the winged Absol still desperately trying to shake the vines and sap away from its face, and the huge Houndoom trying to subdue it. Absol spun about to unleash another attack, successfully shaking away the vines in the process; the flare of energy flew towards the podium but fell short, striking and fizzling out on the asphalt.</p>

<p>"Everybody! Run!" the mayor yelled.</p>

<p>Jett was not asking questions. She tried to run too, on the urging of Muscat, but as she sprinted off the platform her heel caught on the treacherous sidewalk and she tripped.</p>

<p>The Absol at that moment noticed Jett, and seemingly without a second thought leapt at her with claws outstretched. Jett screamed, and tried to shield herself from the attack, only to see the wild Absol get tackled away by Houndoom.</p>

<p>In the same instant Archer darted in front of her, his entire focus on ordering his Pokémon. "Keep it up, Houndoom. Faint Attack!"</p>

<p>Jett stared at the battle between the two strangely evolved Pokémon incredulously. Muscat was suddenly at her side, pulling her up from the sidewalk. "Mrs. Silph, are you unharmed?"</p>

<p>She pushed him away and headed in the direction where Archer's Houndoom was now repelling the Absol.</p>

<p>Looking upward, she saw a balcony that would give her a good vantage point where she could see the fight, and didn't hesitate in sprinting up to the overlook. Muscat, her bodyguard, followed her up.</p>

<p>"Inferno!" shouted Archer.</p>

<p>Houndoom leapt into the air, and the moment its paws hit the asphalt a tidal wave of flame burst outwards, far stronger than any Inferno attack it had been able to use before. Archer started second-guessing the move when he saw just how fearsome it was in his Pokémon's present state. <i>Maybe I'd better not order that again; it might hit the parked cars.</i></p>

<p>Absol narrowly jumped back, avoiding the fire by a whisker's length, however the plant sap on the creature's fur evaporated as a result of the proximity. Absol's unnaturally frizzed fur began to lie flat and its ferocity seemed to die down as well. It had seemingly returned to being a normal Absol, albeit a confused one.</p>

<p>Archer took advantage of the creature being stunned. He seized an empty Poké Ball in his hand and threw it directly at Absol.</p>

<p>It struck Absol's forehead, and there was a flash of light as the Pokémon was swept into the capsule. The Poké Ball landed on the ground, shaking back and forth.</p>

<p>Archer found himself holding his breath with tense expectation, ready to issue another order to Houndoom if need be, till the Poké Ball's flashing indicator light shut off. He'd caught the Absol.</p>

<p>As he walked over and collected the capsule from the ground he suddenly heard cheering. He glanced over to see a small throng of people applauding his victory. Subtly, he winced. He hadn't realized how public the whole battle had been. He looked over at Houndoom to find his Pokémon standing unsteadily, steam wafting off its fur from its body temperature.</p>

<p>Zoe spoke up. "Archer, that was fantastic! ...but why is Houndoom's fur giving off steam?"</p>

<p>Archer knew fire types had higher temperatures than most other Pokémon, but the only time they'd cause actual clouds of steam was when they had a fever. Like had occurred with Absol, the transformation faded, and Houndoom – back to normal – collapsed with exhaustion.</p>

<p>He was immediately at his Pokémon's side. "Houndoom! Are you okay? ...I'd better get you to the Pokémon Center," he murmured, recalling his pet to its Poké Ball.</p>

<p>From her position up on the balcony, Jett watched the events unfold with skepticism.</p>

<p>"Mr. Muscat, who is that trainer?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Find out."</p><h2>Chapter 22 - The Meeting at Quasartico's Headquarters ✅</h2>

<p>Following the Pokémon battle, Archer rushed to the Pokémon Center to heal Houndoom and the newly captured Absol.</p>

<p>He was worried about his Pokémon. He knew plenty about the Houndour line, of which Houndoom was, as far as he knew, the final evolution. He was fairly certain he had never heard anything about the kind of temporary transformation he'd seen it undergo.</p>

<p>Or, for that matter, what he'd seen Absol undergo.</p>

<p>He spoke with Giovanni via a videophone in the Pokémon Center lobby, and related everything that had transpired – from the Unowns and the exotic flowers, to the rogue Absol he had fought and captured.</p>

<p>Giovanni sounded exasperated. "Archer, what did I ever tell you about making a name for Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I believe you said, 'People must feel fear at the name Team Rocket, never laugh at it'."</p>

<p>"I expect that is becoming the case in Lumiose," Giovanni stated.</p>

<p>Archer certainly hoped so. Right now he didn't think that he was becoming feared <i>or</i> mocked by the city folk, but he was probably gaining celebrity.</p>

<p>The conversation with his boss wrapped up and Archer went back to the waiting area of the Pokémon Center.</p>

<p>He didn't have very long to wait before the nurse returned with the Poké Balls, as well as some documents outlining laboratory results of a thorough examination done to both Houndoom and Absol.</p>

<p>Archer gathered all his Poké Balls and went outside to meet up with Zoe. Once outside he took a look at the health report issued by the Pokémon Center when they healed the animals.</p>

<p>"It looks like when they got themselves covered in sap," Archer observed, as he perused the documents, "that caused some sort of an imbalance in their elemental energy."</p>

<p>"So that's what happened to your Houndoom," Zoe said.</p>

<p>Archer thought about this briefly, and the more he did the stranger it seemed. "Sap from a plant couldn't exact such a change in a Pokémon, could it?"</p>

<p>"Is that mega evolution?" Zoe asked.</p>

<p><i>...was it?</i> He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was, it's no good. It seemed like the transformation was causing both Absol and Houndoom pain," he said. A thought occurred to him. "Zoe...the sap and vines the Pokémon were covered in...were they from those flowering plants?"</p>

<p>"They could've been. It certainly looked like the same vines," Zoe considered, "But I've seen large Pals on the island routinely eat them with no problem."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Archer, "but just because they find it tasty doesn't mean its good for them. Anyone can develop allergies."</p>

<p>"The plants release a scent that reminds Pokémon of berries," noted Zoe.</p>

<p>"Why would it send out a scent that would mimic food and lure Pokémon to it? It's almost like the flower wants them to eat it. Or wants them to get near, anyway." Archer reasoned.</p>

<p>"It's a plant," replied Zoe simply.</p>

<p>"But it's got to serve an evolutionary purpose!" insisted Archer.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter." sighed Zoe. "The point is that it's harming the wildlife in Lumiose."</p>

<p>"Not to mention how this could be dangerous if a higher-level Pokémon decides those flowers make a tasty snack," added Archer, "Can you imagine a rampaging, mega-evolved Charizard on the loose?"</p>

<p>"What's a Charizard?" asked Zoe.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Archer, "I'll explain it later... right now these Pokemon need to be fed."</p>

<p>Archer sent out all three of his Pokémon in the fenced-in area behind the Pokémon Center.</p>

<p>"Time to eat!" he said.</p>

<p>He set down dishes of kibble for all the Pokémon. Houndoom wagged its tail, while Frostallion neighed and flapped its wings. The newcomer, Absol, shrank back a bit embarrassed and gazed at its paws.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Archer sighed. "I don't blame you. You were frantic to get those vines off your face."</p>

<p>"Aren't these supposed to be shy Pokémon?" asked Zoe, reading through information on her Pokédex, "They say Absol only appear in front of humans to warn of coming disaster."</p>

<p>"That's an old wives' tale."</p>

<p>"It looks a little like a Felbat," Zoe said. Archer gave her a quizzical look, realizing she was referencing an island Pal, and she elaborated, "Except Felbat are bat like, not leonine. But it has the same color points and the single horn."</p>

<p>Zoe had been scrolling through her Pokédex and then exclaimed, "Here it is! I found Charizard... You know, I've never seen any Pal quite like this. Would you believe we have no real equivalent on Palpagos Island?"</p>

<p>"Now that's an interesting bit of news," chuckled Archer, "so far that seems to be the only Pokémon we've got that you guys don't!"</p>

<p>"Excuse the interruption," a voice spoke behind them and they turned to see a man who added, "My name is Muscat. I am Mrs. Jett Silph's bodyguard...she is the head of Quasartico Inc. She saw you battling today and would like to thank you in person for rescuing her from that vicious Pokémon."</p>

<p><i>She wants to thank us?</i> thought Archer. Unexpected though it was, he could see a potential way to take advantage of the meeting. <i>This could be our chance to find out who in Quasartico is behind the supply drops.</i></p>

<p>"Tell Mrs. Silph," said Archer, "we accept her gracious invitation and will be there within one hour."</p><hr>

<p>They found the headquarters of Quasartico Inc. on the far side of the city. It had modernistic architecture, with glass walls and balconies in an avant garde style that looked almost out of place next to Lumiose's historical boulevards, and an adjoining, fenced-in Pokémon battlefield.</p>

<p>The interior lobby was wide, with stone flooring and a wall topiary arranged in a triangular formation on the right wall, and to the left were glittering holographic displays showcasing the urban redevelopment plans underway for the city. Archer and Zoe went directly up to the reception desk opposite the main entrance.</p>

<p>"The receptionist, who had been looking at some documents on her desk, didn't even raise her head and as she continued sorting the papers asked them, "May I help you?" </p>

<p> "Yes, you may," Archer informed her. "We are looking for Mrs. Jett Silph. She extended an invitation to us to drop by to speak with her."</p>

<p>At this statement, the receptionist looked up from all the paperwork. "Just a moment please," she said as she pushed a button on the intercom and called Jett.</p>

<p>"Let them pass!" Jett was overheard exclaiming.</p>

<p>The pair were let in quickly to meet with her; she began apologizing fast.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I failed to show my appreciation sooner." Jett smiled briefly. "Come in. Do sit down," she said, motioning to two chairs situated in front of her desk. "I wish there was some way to repay the favor...Archer...I remember you from Giovanni's soiree." She looked at Zoe with a perplexed look and said, "Not you, however."</p>

<p>Archer cleared his throat and said, "This is Zoe... she's an associate of ours." He left it at that, and Jett knew better than to question further.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jett, "I am glad you and your fellow associate were around at the right time to help out, but I find it intriguing that Rocket Enterprises is in our fair city."</p>

<p>"The reason we came to Lumiose is that Mr. Delavita sent us to find out who is dropping supplies from an aircraft onto Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>Jett grew quiet all of a sudden and Archer noticed it. <i> She must know something,</i> he thought.</p>

<p>"Why would Mr. Delavita be interested in such a thing?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because he is now the new, legal, owner of Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>"What? How?"</p>

<p>"He bought it."</p>

<p>The silence in the room was so intense that the wind blowing outside the open window in Jett's office sounded noisy. Jett got up and walked towards it. "It's become windy suddenly," she commented as she closed the window.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Silph." Archer paused briefly, "You did say you wished there was a way to repay the favor, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jett, swallowing nervously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be easy for you to find out who exactly is dropping supplies on Palpagos Island." Archer looked at her eyes directly.</p>

<p>Jett stared at him silently for awhile and then looked over at Zoe, who has been sitting observing it all without saying a single word.</p>

<p>Finally Jett spoke. "I am the one ordering the drops."</p>

<p>Archer and Zoe looked at each other wordlessly, and then Archer turned his attention back to Jett.</p>

<p>"Mr. Giovanni Delavita sent us to find out who was coordinating the supply drops and to inform them that because Palpagos Island is now under the direction and control of Rocket Enterprises, Mr. Marcus Dryden will not be negotiating any business deals from this point forward, so adjust yourself accordingly."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jett. She paused, as if thinking things through in her mind. "Perhaps your boss and I could do business...it doesn't matter to me who my business partner is as long as my company doesn't suffer financially."</p>

<p>"I will relay that information to Giovanni," Archer replied. "If he decides to do that, he will most likely set the terms and conditions."</p>

<p>Jett smiled. "Oh, I'm sure your boss and I could come to an agreement," she said, "after all, money does talk. Perhaps if I could meet with him directly..."</p>

<p>Archer put a hand into the air to stop Jett speaking, then said, "Giovanni has made it perfectly clear that his message to you is to let you know your business transactions with Marcus will stop, and the drops onto the island should stop. He considers imparting this message to you, a courtesy."</p>

<p>Jett's face reflected a slight frown, but she replied nothing as Archer and Zoe got up from their seats to leave. "You will hear from us again," he added.</p>

<p>Jett didn't know what to think. She felt sick to her stomach at the thought of being placed in a similar situation her late husband had once been in.</p>

<p><i>Team Rocket doesn't hold power in Kalos,</i> some part of her mind reasoned, <i>they can't do anything here without falling afoul of Corbeau. But Corbeau doesn't know anything about this business with Marcus, does he? And Marcus himself; how will he take it if I cut off the supply drops? ...Oh, why couldn't the city council have just approved those demolition permits?</i></p><hr>

<p>Corbeau had many contacts in the city of Lumiose, be they people loyal to him, or people who owed him, or people who wanted to garner favor with him. He had no shortage of these fountains of information in his syndicate's territory, so it was rare that he would be unaware of events within the Kalos region.</p>

<p>This was, ironically, why Corbeau was uneasy after having heard from the city mayor that evening. As soon as he'd run through all the scheduled gym battles with the day's challengers, he returned to his office in a great haste.</p>

<p>One thing was rogue wild Pokémon; he'd heard about that too, and while he could imagine it looking bad for Quasartico and their urban redevelopment, Jett already had most of the project completed, and anyone with the means to make it an issue could be convinced to overlook the whole thing with a bit of bribery or old-fashioned coercion. Corbeau didn't think it was that important. However, the fact that the latest rogue Pokémon had been quelled by a skilled trainer from outside Kalos? Who, upon further inquiry, turned out to be the godson of Giovanni Delavita – the don of Team Rocket?</p>

<p><i>That</i> was concerning to Corbeau. He didn't like the idea that a Team Rocket admin had shown up unannounced to Rust Syndicate territory, and even worse he hadn't heard a single thing about it till said Team Rocket admin made a blatant spectacle by catching a rampaging wild Pokémon in the middle of the city. Corbeau half-wondered if the whole thing had been staged just to send a message.</p>

<p>Corbeau called some of his agents to meet with him in his office and asked them what they'd been able to learn so far about Archer Verdi and his intentions. They didn't have much new to say about the Team Rocket admin, except for one tidbit.</p>

<p>"He was overheard outside the Pokémon Center discussing plans to participate in the Z-A Royale tonight."</p>

<p>"The battle tournament?" Corbeau considered this briefly. "Well, maybe that would be a fitting place to coincide with our unexpected visitor."</p>

<p>He glanced up at his subordinates, who all stood expectantly at attention.</p>

<p>"I want to know whether Team Rocket is here on a mission of peace or war," ordered Corbeau. "If they are here for peace, then we will welcome them to Lumiose City in kind."</p>

<p>"...and if they're here for war?"</p>

<p>"I hope that's not the case." Corbeau's eyes glinted. "But if it is, even rockets can rust."</p><h2>Chapter 23 - Corbeau ✅</h2>

<p>Archer began watching the clock as soon as it hit nightfall, and at the designated hour he set out walking from the hotel, down the bustling sidewalk, to take part in the Z-A Royale battle competition that was being held nearby.</p>

<p>The designated streets were marked by a red energy barrier. It was easy to see the shimmer of light coming up the sidewalk, along with the ticket booth with a line of trainers and Pokémon in front, and the tall banners advertising its sponsors – one of which was, unsurprisingly, the land development company Quasartico Inc.</p>

<p>Archer entered Houndoom, and was given a ticket into the area. He was also reminded of the competition rules:</p>

<p>Anyone walking in the cordoned-off streets with a Pokémon is fair game. You lose if your Pokémon is knocked out. Anyone who still has their Pokémon in fighting condition by sunrise will advance to the next day's round.</p>

<p>And, of course, you're supposed to ambush other trainers' Pokémon in battle before they see you.</p>

<p>It was like a watered-down version of Team Rocket training, and Archer excelled at it. Within the first hour he and Houndoom had won against three other trainers, without incurring much damage themselves, and without anybody having been able to ambush them back. What to the rest of the trainers there was probably a challenge was child's play to him, especially considering the events on Palpagos Island still being fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>Archer kept to the shadows, as lithe as ever, with Houndoom close at his heels. He picked out their next target – a novice trainer, who was lingering around a tree with their sheep Pokémon, Mareep.</p>

<p>"Them," he whispered to Houndoom, "That Mareep looks to be a low enough level that you can probably one-shot it. Start with..."</p>

<p>He could barely finish the command. Seemingly out of nowhere, a barrage of sludge struck Houndoom, which yelped and spun about growling to face the attacker. Archer turned immediately to come face-to-face with Corbeau.</p>

<p>Beside him stood a tall, bipedal black lizard, with pink markings across its torso and a narrow, crocodilian snout, that Archer recognized as a Salazzle.</p>

<p>Corbeau was quick to order a second attack. "We've got the advantage now! Follow up with Poison Fang."</p>

<p>"Houndoom, Faint Attack," Archer called, reorienting himself to their new foe.</p>

<p>The battle was frenetic. Salazzle whipped about, while Houndoom bounded backwards to evade its snapping attacks and lunged to deliver its own.</p>

<p>While he kept his attention primarily on the two Pokémon fighting in front of him, Archer was nonetheless aware of people stationed on the rooftops and surrounding areas outside of the Royale streets, watching the battle between him and Corbeau play out with keen eyes. They were stoic figures with dark suits that bore a rhombus-shaped logo similar to that of the Lumiose gym's current badge design, and their Pokémon standing at their side awaiting an order.</p>

<p><i>Rust Syndicate members,</i> Archer deduced, <i>no doubt here to guard their boss, but they could just as easily be made to launch an attack from their positions.</i></p>

<p>Corbeau, however, displayed no inclination of being preoccupied with anything other than the battle competition before him.</p>

<p>"Sludge Wave," Corbeau ordered his Pokémon, "try to knock it down!"</p>

<p>Salazzle sent forth another surge of mire towards Houndoom. Archer held back till he saw the crest of sludge rise and then seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>"Now, Houndoom, straight through the sludge!" shouted Archer.</p>

<p>Houndoom leapt through the wave, its jaws alight with flame, to tackle into its opponent. Salazzle hissed, tripping back but catching itself at the last instant on all fours.</p>

<p>Archer saw Corbeau clench his teeth briefly in frustration, and his features contort into a frown; evidently the maneuver had been unexpected. Witnessing the reaction made Archer smirk. <i>If he thinks I'm going to make this an easy win, he's got another thing coming!</i></p>

<p>Salazzle writhed about with surprising swiftness, leaping back onto its hind legs and rushing in for the counterattack. Houndoom dodged, but nonetheless swayed on its paws. <i>It must've been affected by those poison attacks,</i> thought Archer, <i>I'd better try to end the fight fast.</i></p>

<p>"Inferno!"</p>

<p>"Flamethrower!"</p>

<p>The two Pokémon unleashed their fire attacks at the same time, with the moves striking them both head-on. Salazzle reeled backwards and collapsed, while Houndoom stumbled to the ground as well; with both knocked out, the battle had ended in a draw.</p>

<p>"Not bad," said Corbeau, recalling Salazzle to its Poké Ball. "It appears everything I was told was true about Team Rocket agents and the excellence of their battling skill."</p>

<p>"We pride ourselves with good training," Archer replied simply, as he also called Houndoom into its sphere.</p>

<p>Corbeau put out his hand and Archer shook it, so Corbeau asked him a question point blank. "Why is Team Rocket in my territory? Surely you didn't travel all this way for a simple contest?"</p>

<p>"Team Rocket business that needed to be addressed," Archer answered, then tucked Houndoom's Poké Ball into his pocket and walked away.</p>

<p>Corbeau watched him leave and summoned two of his agents. "Don't let him out of your sight...keep me informed of his every move...who he sees, speaks with, where he's staying."</p>

<p>"Yes sir." The agents saluted and ran off after Archer, keeping a distance so as to not be noticed.</p>

<p>Corbeau was pensive. "I'll get to the bottom of this," he said to himself.</p><hr>

<p>Corbeau arrived at his office bright and early the next morning. He dialed a number on the telephone on his desk and after a couple of rings a receptionist answered it. "Rocket Enterprises; kindly state your business."</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Corbeau of Rust Industries. Please tell Mr. Giovanni Delavita I request to speak with him."</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes, Giovanni came on the line. "Corbeau, what a surprise! What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Giovanni, I know you're a busy man, but there is a question I have that has been causing me some concern... Why did your people pay a visit to Jett of Quasartico? I know it wasn't just a vacation or passing through. Our families have been neutral since before you and I were born...I am guessing there's a logical explanation for the minor intrusion."</p>

<p>Giovanni let him finish speaking his piece, and when he got silent he replied:</p>

<p>"It seems Jett has a business arrangement with Marcus Dryden who was the former controller of Palpagos Island..."</p>

<p>"Former?" Corbeau interrupted with surprise.</p>

<p>Giovanni ignored him and continued speaking. "I am now the  new legal owner of the island and I have a feud going with Dryden. He is unreasonable and disrespectful so he will be evicted, one way or another. Jett needs to stop all business with him. If she wants to do business with me that's another issue altogether. This is not a turf war between you and me."</p>

<p>"Well, firstly congratulations on your new land acquisition and business endeavor... Secondly, I am glad to hear our families can proceed in peace. I will speak with Jett and tell her to stay out of your way."</p>

<p>"Good," Giovanni answered, "It's also good that we can discuss these things man to man in a civilized way."</p>

<p>"Have a good day, Giovanni."</p>

<p>"<i>Ciao</i>," Giovanni replied, and the two men hung up their phones.</p>

<p>Following the conversation with Giovanni, Corbeau asked Jett to come speak with him. She arrived at the gym promptly and they met at his office there.</p>

<p>"Hello Corbeau," greeted Jett, "what's wrong? You seemed rather terse when you spoke over the phone. Is something the matter?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to discuss your business partner, Marcus Dryden," he said.</p>

<p>He noticed her waver, only a bit, but it was perceptible.</p>

<p>Corbeau waved a hand dismissively as he elaborated, "I know you have a business deal with him. What is it, exactly?"</p>

<p>"Well, he gets shipments of items...simple things...whatever he requests, really."</p>

<p>"...and what do you get in return?"</p>

<p>"The flowers, for one."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are a novelty," Corbeau considered, "and grow extraordinarily fast. If this keeps up they're going to reach as tall as the bamboo we've got in the gym's foyer."</p>

<p>He straightened his glasses and looked at her directly. Jett met his golden gaze, but said nothing. It was Corbeau who spoke again:</p>

<p>"You can't be flying out weekly shipments of crude oil, potions, and ammunition in return for only a measly fifty pots of flowers."</p>

<p>Corbeau knew more than he let on, Jett realized; perhaps he had made inquiries, or was particularly astute to whatever was going on in his territory, yet the fact of the matter was that he somehow knew these things. All at once, Jett decided it would be best if she admitted everything. She did not want to be accused of misleading him; yes, maybe she <i>had</i> been misleading him, only a little, but she didn't see how her business with the Palpagos Island leader concerned him or his organization.</p>

<p>"It was more than the flowers," Jett admitted. "They were intended to be a sort of interest accrued till Marcus could make arrangements for the real reimbursement. He was planning to invade Kalos, and I was going to take advantage of it by having him destroy the south-east side of Lumiose City, which I can't get the demolition permits for."</p>

<p>The reaction she got from Corbeau was a stunned stare.</p>

<p>"I know what you must be thinking..." Jett said, suddenly feeling self-conscious about the admission, "There's no way he can <i>really</i> take over. He doesn't have nearly the amount of manpower to contend with the mainland armies, even with the lasers... and with your people of course."</p>

<p>"Jett," he said, "What made you <i>ever</i> think that this was a good idea?"</p>

<p>She blinked, her expression almost innocuous. "It seemed like it would turn a profit."</p>

<p>Corbeau thought about her words for a moment, and then began laughing. It was a bitter sort of laugh, and Jett shifted her posture uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"All right," Corbeau stopped laughing and smiled at her, "I can appreciate a financial gamble, even something as outlandish as destroying half of Lumiose. I'll even overlook that it's technically part of my territory, too."</p>

<p>She winced noticeably.</p>

<p>"You owe me for two favors," said Corbeau, holding out his fingers to number them. "The first was getting your company the green light to renovate Prism Tower. The second was getting the buildings around the tower to be sold to you. The time has come for you to repay those favors."</p>

<p>Jett was starting to look nervous, but she swallowed the dryness in her throat. "What do you request?"</p>

<p>"First...cut off your business deal with Mr. Dryden."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Cut off your business deal with Mr. Dryden," Corbeau reiterated. "Palpagos Island is now Team Rocket territory and Marcus Dryden is waging war against them; I won't have anyone getting involved in it from within my territory. My family has always been neutral with the Delavitas and I intend to keep peace with Team Rocket even now."</p>

<p>"I don't think Marcus will take it very well..." Jett began to say, "the supply drops have been going on for years..."</p>

<p>Corbeau studied her quietly. "Jett, we've always been good business associates. I really would find it lamentable if our acquaintanceship...<i>soured</i>."</p>

<p>His voice was pleasant as ever, but the insinuations were there. Jett had no desire to contend with the cruel realities of crossing his organization. She knew Corbeau well enough to know that beyond any cordiality they showed one another, what they had between them was a business arrangement, and dissolving that arrangement on less than agreeable terms could turn out to be lethal.</p>

<p>"No, no I would feel the same," she concurred hastily. "I'll end the deal with Marcus Dryden."</p>

<p>Corbeau returned a nod, as if her answer suited him. "I'll see if anything can be done about your demolition permits, but for now forget about south-east Lumiose. I will withhold the second request...for the moment. Tell me as soon as you've completed the first."</p>

<p>"There's just one problem..." said Jett, looking dispirited, "I don't have any way to contact him. Not yet, anyway. He had to leave his base in a hurry because of Team Rocket and so he claimed <i>he</i> would contact me."</p>

<p>"Then as soon as you hear from him, you tell him the deal is off," Corbeau replied. "No more shipments, not even a single potion."</p>

<p>Jett had never felt quite so worried as she did that day, leaving Corbeau's office and returning to her own. The first thing she did was sit at her desk and hold her head in her hands, completely desolate in her predicament.</p>

<p>She glanced absently at the flowering plant. It had grown considerably, and was already almost the size of a potted palm and had been placed to the side of her desk.</p>

<p>Jett observed it with a sort of mild curiosity. The blossom itself was nearly as big as that of a sunflower. <i>It's going to grow as massive as a tree if this keeps up,</i> she thought.</p><h2>Chapter 24 - Poké Balls and Pal Spheres ✅</h2>

<p>The next day started out fairly rainy, and the downpour lasted throughout the day till subsiding around late afternoon. Because of this Archer forwent any outings, instead remaining in the hotel where he and Zoe had gotten rooms during their stay in Lumiose City.</p>

<p>Zoe had stepped out momentarily to get food at the cafeteria located in the ground floor. "I'll get take out," she had told Archer, and he went along with it, primarily because he wanted some time alone to think things through.</p>

<p>It was then that he received a video phone call from a familiar trio – James, Jessie, and Meowth.</p>

<p>James spoke first. "The boss wants you back on the island," he said.</p>

<p>Meowth leapt in with a yowl. "We've got that eco-delegation flying in that're supposed to sign off on the rare Pokémon here not being threatened or whatnot. It's to make the boss' purchase of Palpagos Island official."</p>

<p>"Not like getting that approval should be any trouble for Team Rocket," added Jessie mischievously.</p>

<p>"Well, it looks like the three of you have been busy," Archer said tongue in cheek, "Any mishaps? Not that I haven't had my own to contend with."</p>

<p>"Archer, out of all the members of Team Rocket, you're the one that's got the worst luck," Jessie pointed out.</p>

<p>Archer fixed a skeptical look on the unanimously bright eyes of Jessie, James, and Meowth. "Come again?"</p>

<p>James grinned. "That's even considering Pete's incident with the mangoes. We all took a vote yesterday with the minions. You won."</p>

<p>"Or lost?" asked Archer.</p>

<p>"Depending on how you look at it."</p>

<p>"I take it that's also considering how your <i>own</i> combined party of Pokémon got thrashed by a Pikachu you tried to steal, only to find out it belonged to the boss' son?" said Archer, glancing at them sideways.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, way worse than that," Meowth purred, squinting his eyes.</p>

<p>"You're always getting into trouble," Jessie went on with a smile. "Since we're Team Rocket's double-trouble experts, it's our pleasure to announce that you're the current poster child for 'shit happens'."</p>

<p>"Believe me, it's not by intent," Archer replied, now feeling a bit mortified.</p>

<p>Even as he hung up the call, he knew his three friends meant no harm by bringing up the obvious about his being unfairly disaster prone, but it settled on his mind irrepressibly for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The stress was finally catching up to Archer. Apprehension first from his run-in with Marcus Dryden and his poison plot, and then from witnessing how the island people were being held captive at the factory – they'd managed to rescue them, and he felt a little relief by that at least – and now the harrowing incident with the Absol. All of this brought back lingering, horrific recollections of a prior enslavement that were worse still.</p>

<p>Which led at last to him saying "Fuck it" and ensconcing himself in the lounge of the hotel that evening with a bottle of wine and a mission.</p>

<p>Zoe went looking for Archer and found him there, at a table beside one of the wide windows overlooking the cityscape, pouring out yet another goblet of pinot noir. His Houndoom was loyally sitting at his feet but looking undeniably concerned for its trainer. The lounge was relatively quiet, with only the bartender drying glassware behind the counter and a Squirtle trying to help out, none of whom took an interest in Zoe as she went over to Archer's table.</p>

<p>"Zoe... I wondered how long it would be before you found me," he commented with a tired voice.</p>

<p>"How many drinks have you had?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not enough yet. I want to get as absolutely wasted as I can for the rest of the night."</p>

<p>"Archer, you're going to get drunk."</p>

<p>"Is being sober better? ...Hey, my wine bottle," he protested mildly as she took it away.</p>

<p>"What if Giovanni sees you like this?" Zoe pursued, sitting down in the other chair at the table.</p>

<p>Archer frowned at the thought; the mere idea of displeasing Giovanni, who he held in such high admiration, made him reconsider his actions. "Well, if I'm not going to drink myself into oblivion, I need another vice. Maybe I could take up smoking."</p>

<p>Zoe's gaze softened, "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing important."</p>

<p>"It's important enough that you want to get drunk over it. Besides, I thought drunks were supposed to tell their woes to the bartender."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but the bartender will give them liquor when they ask for it, and you've confiscated my wine. No, you're right. I'm overdoing it, but I'm still not going to tell you a single thing."</p>

<p>Zoe put the bottle back in front of him and said, "I do wish you'd open up to me a bit more. I'm willing to listen, and I won't judge."</p>

<p>Archer gazed into the drink before him, mired in relentless memories. His thoughts were already growing hazy, and the thought of lying down in bed was starting to appeal to him.</p>

<p>He picked the bottle up and then as if rethinking it, put it back down and sighed.</p>

<p>Houndoom meanwhile observed him closely and wanting to remind its trainer of its presence, barked and lay a paw on his lap. Archer petted the dog.</p>

<p>Houndoom had been taken from him when he'd been captured and put through its own ordeal; his Pokémon could understand him perhaps better than anyone. However the recollection of that time didn't affect it as bad.</p>

<p>Almost as a perfectly on-cue example of this, Houndoom nudged at Archer until he produced its Poké Ball for it, and with another happy bark the dog poked the button with its nose. The Poké Ball's lid opened and Houndoom entered the capsule in a red flare.</p>

<p>He studied the sphere meditatively, so deep in thought it surprised him when Zoe laid her hand across his, and he looked up at her. "Archer, <i>please</i> tell me," Zoe coaxed.</p>

<p>Archer relented, and decided to tell her the story.</p>

<p>"Some time ago, Team Rocket was in the middle of a mob war. I was caught by an enemy of ours – like an animal, in a Poké Ball. Where I come from, by law Poké Balls have a safety mechanism added to prevent human beings from being caught. This one had been illegally manufactured without it, so it worked like the Pal Spheres on Palpagos Island."</p>

<p>Some part of recounting this was like prodding at a scab, all the more uncomfortable for Archer because he felt it should have healed by now. Zoe seemed to realize, and interjected:</p>

<p>"There shouldn't be this kind of stigma attached to being held hostage that way. It happened to me briefly. It happened to all those people we rescued who'd been forced to slave in Marcus' factory."</p>

<p>"Would it be only the indignity. At least those people preserved some sense of self," Archer said. "My captor used a Pokémon with psychic attacks so they'd know my thoughts, and if I had any that fell short of compliance it brought punishment."</p>

<p>He was briefly quiet.</p>

<p>"By the time they were through with me, I was willing to do anything they wanted. I'd roll over and <i>beg</i> if they demanded it, and if I wasn't fast enough or precise enough I'd willingly accept the torture that followed. The Poké Ball became a sanctuary from pain. I was so desperate to live, I didn't realize they'd succeeded in killing who I was," admitted Archer, his voice soft as he leant back.</p>

<p>"How did you get out?" asked Zoe.</p>

<p>"I saw a old family photograph," Archer reminisced. "I remembered everything at that moment. The first thing I did was try to shoot my 'trainer' – and miss. Someone else in Team Rocket got the asshole later."</p>

<p>He was gazing pensively out at the last faint flickers of sunlight below the horizon, and how they cast receding shades of orange and pink. Those sinister days and nights he'd spent locked in the capsule, called out to be commanded like a Pokémon; dull obedience interspersed with moments of unyielding terror, which ran into months that blended ceaselessly into an abyss...</p>

<p>He'd probably never truly get over the experience, although he'd learned to live with the toll it had invariably taken, and that was okay too...<i>yet</i>...</p>

<p>"Giovanni says I didn't fail our organization; not everyone can handle what I was put through. Personally I think he's trying to be kind and not admit I'm a coward. I'm afraid of being taken prisoner again, because I know they can break me if I'm put through that kind of hell once more."</p>

<p>"That's not being a coward," Zoe spoke up. "You know what you can take and can't. It's a different kind of strength to be able to accept your limits. Actually, I admire you now more than ever Archer."</p>

<p>He looked up at her in surprise. "Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You survived. Your mind and your determination were strong enough to fight back in the end."</p>

<p>He didn't know what to say to that. He was wondering if he should have even told her the anecdote; it was a horrible experience he rarely spoke about to anybody, but part of him was grateful she'd listened to it anyway. Then another part of him worried his preoccupation in the moment was mawkish.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," Archer replied, "I hadn't thought about it in that way…until now."</p>

<p>"Sometimes it helps to tell someone your troubles," Zoe said, "Someone you trust...and I hope you trust me Archer, because I certainly trust you."</p>

<p>Archer looked at her and smiled. "Sure I trust you," he replied, "That's why I've told you my story...just don't go saying it around will you? Only close Team Rocket associates know about it."</p>

<p>"No worries Archer," Zoe said smiling back.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure if he imagined the delicate blush on her cheeks, or the way their eyes held each other's gaze for just long enough for a magnetic warmth to spread over him; the moment, if it had occurred, passed as swift as a Spearow.</p>

<p>"Zoe, I really am thankful of all the help you've given me...and of your friendship." He paused here and added, "I like you a lot."</p>

<p>Zoe looked in his eyes and replied, "...and I'm thankful I met you." </p>

<p> He stared at her briefly, then leaned over to her and kissed her gently on the lips, as a response. She returned the kiss and Archer gathered her in his arms and held her for along time. Eventually he whispered in her ear, "You know, I'm not staying on the island Zoe...and...I have no intentions of showing up with a wife in tow when I return home."</p>

<p>"I understand," she answered, "though, technically, my people did marry us according to their laws. So, I'll just tell them that we broke up when you leave Palpagos Island. Ever since Giovanni ordered them to be formally trained by Team Rocket they've begun adapting their ways."</p>

<p>"Well then...my room has plenty of privacy," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes it does," Zoe said, turning her face to look at him directly. "Take me there."</p>

<p>Without hesitation, he picked her up and carried her into the elevator and to his room, bolting the door behind him.</p>

<p>The world faded away in their togetherness, and for a while there was nothing else.</p><h2>Chapter 25 - Three Times the Effort ✅</h2>

<p>Archer was happy when they finally returned to Palpagos Island, though he was aware that they likely hadn't seen the last of Lumiose City. He was being called back for only a short period of time, to oversee the delegation's arrival and help out a bit with the new plasteel weapons that were being devised.</p>

<p>Zoe, to the contrary, seemed a little downhearted about leaving the mainland so soon. <i>I guess she's grown to like it there,</i> Archer thought.</p>

<p>Quasartico's connections with the island were intriguing, and certainly merited further investigation, but the delegation's signing was the most important thing right now. Their signed document would turn over the territory officially to Giovanni. Once this triviality was out of the way, then they'd see what to do about Marcus – <i>and</i> Jett.</p>

<p>The council's ecological delegation arrived on Palpagos Island only two hours after Archer and Zoe had returned.</p>

<p>They arrived via propeller airplane, which landed smoothly on the beach. Giovanni and several of the minions met them in civilian attire, of course, because they were very astute about keeping up appearances even if it was a sham and everyone knew they were Team Rocket. The delegation consisted of Professor Oak and Professor Rowan, both of whom had ample claim to be there as wildlife biologists.</p>

<p>It so happened this was the same day that a few more Team Rocket minions would be flying in too, bringing more supplies, as well as Giovanni's lawyer to notarize the documents, and Dr. Colress, a scientist who often worked with their organization in secret on the basis of scientific interest. They were instructed to land in a wooded clearing some distance from the beach so as not to arouse attention.</p>

<p>The two people on the delegation had been taken to the Team Rocket encampment and so was the group with the lawyer and Colress.</p>

<p>"Dr. Colress? What are you doing on this island?" asked Oak with surprise upon seeing him arrive at the campsite.</p>

<p>"I was invited by Mr. Delavita." The scientist gave a cordial dip of his head.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Rowan, with a hint of skepticism in his voice, "didn't you formerly work for Team Plasma...?"</p>

<p>"That was some time ago," Colress dismissed with ease, "In any case, Team Plasma and the civil war in Unova is past history now."</p>

<p>"I presume you're here for your own study on the wildlife?"</p>

<p>"Tangentially. My current research is focused elsewhere. That said, I'm aware the old literature has some fascinating implications," Colress noted. "Supposedly all the animals on this island have unique characteristics only observed here."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately at the same time modern taxonomical research was making strides, this region was cut off from mainland civilization," Oak explained, "so it was impossible to scientifically categorize the wildlife in proper terms. It will be interesting to finally observe them firsthand."</p>

<p>At this point, Archer walked up to the delegation. "Colress! Hello," he greeted the scientist with a handshake.</p>

<p>"Hello Archer, you're looking well," Colress replied.</p>

<p>"Doing my best as usual." Archer then added, "I hate to interrupt this reunion of sorts but Giovanni asks to speak with you, Dr. Colress."</p>

<p>"Indeed, well we mustn't keep him waiting. Lead the way Archer," the scientist motioned with a wave of his hand and Archer walked ahead to Giovanni's yacht.</p><hr>

<p>At the meeting with Giovanni, Colress looked over the stolen weaponry blueprints and gave his opinions on them. Afterwards, he was invited by the Team Rocket don to dine aboard the yacht during the lunch hour.</p>

<p>The delegation in turn were offered an abundant luncheon at the future hotel site that was already partially built. It had a terrace overlooking the sea, which was where the food was served and where they were supposed to gather and sign documents.</p>

<p>Technically, of course, Rocket Enterprises should never have begun construction without the delegation's approval. They had to affirm any development would have little effect on the island cloistered environment with its unique Pokémon species or whatever it was they were supposed to protect. However, when had that ever stopped Team Rocket? For that matter, they weren't supposed to be out catching wildlife from the forest yet, but the grunts had already probably caught at least a hundred by now. Any complaint lodged by a delegation member to that effect would probably be the last they'd ever file.</p>

<p>Archer snickered slyly at the mere thought.</p>

<p>About a couple of hours had passed when he wandered outside and heard a commotion coming from the direction of the hotel site. Archer looked over with boredom. "What now?" he asked a Team Rocket minion who was walking by.</p>

<p>"The delegation is infighting," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Infighting? What the fuck! All they have to do is sign the damn papers Giovanni told them to! Are they suicidal?"</p>

<p>"Sir, it seems that the two professors don't see eye to eye on some issues." The minion saluted and walked on.</p>

<p>"I sure am curious to see what the fuck it's all about," Archer spoke aloud to himself.</p>

<p>"I'm heading there myself," said a familiar voice. Archer turned to see Colress behind him. "Come along if you like."</p>

<p>Archer had to see this for himself, so he followed Colress over to where the Pokémon professors were seated on the newly built seaside terrace. Zoe's pet Pengullet was sitting atop the coffee table in the middle, happily munching on some berries from the centerpiece basket.</p>

<p>Professor Oak was speaking. "These are regional forms and we need to classify them in taxonomy as such."</p>

<p>"In that you're incorrect," insisted Rowan. "They are distinct species."</p>

<p>"Professor Rowan, I agree they've developed natural adaptations to survive here, adaptations which also happen to have been observed in otherwise unrelated species. However, this does not make <i>these animals</i> distinct species."</p>

<p>"Granted, they may have hybridization somewhere along their meta-evolutional lines..."</p>

<p>"Oh, so now they're hybrids?" Oak challenged. He gestured towards Pengullet, which looked at him blankly. "That is quite clearly a form of Piplup."</p>

<p>Rowan was undeterred. "Piplup are native to the Sinnoh region where I have lived my whole life. That is not a Piplup. It lacks downy feathers."</p>

<p>"The Piplup we have known till now are only found in northern climates, so it stands to reason those that found themselves stranded in the tropics would, over time, lose their down to compensate for the temperature."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. It's simply another avian." Rowan replied firmly. "Professor Oak, you would not call a Meowth and a Purrloin regional forms of each other merely because they are both members of the cat family and inhabit the same position in their respective habitats?"</p>

<p>Oak frowned, but stood his ground. "The Meowth and Purrloin lines have entirely different classifications and appearance and diverged in prehistoric times. One could say their primary ancestor had more in common with Mew than either of them."</p>

<p>"If I might intrude," said Colress, straightening his eyeglasses, "why don't we simply do a genetic analysis of the creatures and compare them to known samples before debating the proper vernacular?"</p>

<p>Both Oak and Rowan scoffed at this.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be nearly as fun as debating the issue," said Oak.</p>

<p>"Nor as philosophical," agreed Rowan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but it would be far more efficient," Colress replied.</p>

<p>Archer, far from defusing the situation, decided to add fuel to the fire. "Besides," interjected Archer with a smile, "...it's damn obvious what's what on the island." He placed a Pal Sphere on the coffee table.</p>

<p>"Would you say this is a Poké Ball?" he asked the professors.</p>

<p>"Now, let's not start another frivolous debate we all know the answer to," Rowan dismissed.</p>

<p>"Do we?" questioned Oak, raising an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Anyway. Your little dispute here isn't going to impede the signing of Giovanni's documents, I trust," added Archer, glancing pointedly from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Oh certainly not," they both jumped to say.</p>

<p>They knew very well what Team Rocket expected of them. Archer was only a tad disappointed that he wouldn't have an excuse to beat someone up over being dumb.</p>

<p>Archer continued watching them bicker for a while longer. He really didn't know what to think of this show. Even considering his own personal convictions that the island animals had undeniable familiarity, after having watched this scientific spat go on fruitlessly between Oak and Rowan for practically the entire day they had been here, Archer was getting fed up with it and found himself wanting everyone to come to a truce and just agree Piplup and Pengullet were damned penguins.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, Kris came over to talk to the professors.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," she said, "Do any of you have an expertise in Pokémon breeding...?"</p>

<p>"Dear girl, we <i>both</i> can be considered as having expertise in all facets of Pokémon," Rowan said.</p>

<p>Kris didn't question the statement and jumped right in to say her piece. "My Eevee has been very friendly with one of the Cremis here on the island...I think it's a girl. My Eevee is a boy..."</p>

<p>"Well that makes sense," replied Oak, with a sideways glare at Rowan, "if they both perceive they are of equal species."</p>

<p>"Well, now they have an egg," Kris added.</p>

<p>That was all she had to say. The professors immediately dropped everything and ran to see her Pokémon. Archer followed at a more leisurely pace.</p>

<p>They found Cremis curled around an egg and a determined Eevee guarding them both. It growled when it saw the bunch of people approaching to warn them not to get too close.</p>

<p>"A-ha!" Oak exclaimed, "Definitive, conclusive proof that Cremis is a regional form of Eevee."</p>

<p>"Now now," Rowan rushed to reply, "this only shows that they happen to be categorized in the same egg group. Remember the Skitty and Wailord genetic study?"</p>

<p>"That was theoretical nonsense," countered Oak. "This is the real thing."</p>

<p>"It merits further investigation before we jump to any conclusions," Rowan insisted.</p>

<p>Archer meanwhile had dollar signs in his eyes. "This is excellent," he said, turning towards his sister. "Kris, bring the Cremis back to the mainland with us. If their kits inherit the shiny color, you keep breeding them and our organization will make a fortune."</p>

<p>Both Oak and Rowan shot to attention at this.</p>

<p>"You can't be considering selling these! Their offspring could be a potential scientific breakthrough!" Rowan protested.</p>

<p>"Whether they're regional forms or separate species, these are not common Pokémon," Oak added.</p>

<p>"Professors, might I remind you both who owns this island? ...and everything inhabiting it?" Archer posed a veiled threat.</p>

<p>His statement visibly made both of them meek, to Archer's contentment. They turned back to the egg.</p>

<p>"Has anyone other than you, Kris, tried to pet them?" asked Oak.</p>

<p>"Actually...no." Kris answered, "but you can try."</p>

<p>Oak bent down closer to the little animals and slowly tried to pet them. This made Eevee growl louder.</p>

<p>Rowan then tried his luck at petting them, and Cremis snapped at him. He jumped back rubbing his hand.</p>

<p>They all then glanced almost hopefully at Archer, who shook his head. "I'm not even going to try," he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Colress came by at the moment, and noticing the nest and the two Pokémon, reached in without hesitation and petted them both. Eevee and Cremis began to purr loudly.</p>

<p>"How come only Colress can examine them?" demanded Rowan.</p>

<p>Kris shrugged. "What can I say? They like Colress."</p>

<p>By late afternoon Giovanni summoned the delegation members, his lawyer who was acting as notary, and a few others to witness the document signing, which was required to make his purchase of the isle official. There was a table outside on the beach, under a cloth awning held up by four stakes in the ground; on the table was the document with six pens lined up in a row, a bottle of red wine with several goblets, and a small vase with hibiscus flowers that gave off a somewhat cheerful ambiance.</p>

<p>Everyone was silently waiting around here for Giovanni to give a signal of sorts to begin the event, and no one broke this uneasy vigil till he emerged from the office aboard his yacht accompanied by his private guards Jessie and James.</p>

<p>"Let's get this done," ordered the leader of Team Rocket. He motioned to the two professors and they approached the table. Giovanni handed Professor Oak a pen and his lawyer pointed to a spot on the paper for him to sign. He did so quickly. The same was done for Professor Rowan, who signed with a slight tremble of his hand. Next, Giovanni took a pen for himself and signed the document, which effectively made him responsible for the island and its upkeep, and then Jessie and James put their signatures to paper as the two required witnesses. Last but not least, the lawyer signed to officially recognize the entire transaction.</p>

<p>Giovanni opened the bottle of wine, poured drinks for everyone and raising his glass, offered a toast. "To the prosperous future of Rocket Enterprises. <i>Saluté</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Saluté</i>," repeated everyone. The two professors shook hands with Giovanni and headed off to an awaiting helicopter that would take them home to the mainland, while everyone else went on with their day. As the sun began its descent in the evening sky, Giovanni and his lawyer returned to the don's office to discuss business.</p>

<p>Palpagos Island was now officially and legally Team Rocket territory, regardless of whatever claims Marcus Dryden may have still had to the contrary.</p><hr>

<p>During the days Archer and Zoe had been in Lumiose, Marcus Dryden had not been sighted by Team Rocket or Syndicate scouting parties anywhere. A state of unease prevailed; everyone in Team Rocket knew they had not seen the last of their enemies and it was only a matter of time before there would be a hit.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, their plans had been proceeding without a hitch. They'd seized the town of Fisherman's Point from the PIDF soldiers guarding it, who put up a fight but were ultimately vanquished in a couple of days, and were currently locked in battle around Feybreak Cove; it was generally assumed that if Marcus was hiding out anywhere, it was there. In the meantime, as a result of the tumblestone and gold that were so easy to come by and the crude oil they were extracting in abundance, Team Rocket had a very good supply of plasteel by now; enough to not only produce the weapons outlined in the supply drop blueprints but also to start manufacturing Master Balls back home. Giovanni was pleased, and Archer was happy to see his godfather's longtime plans coming to fruition.</p>

<p>Archer had been busy all that next morning, so it was mid-afternoon when he was free of any pending duties and went to see what Colress was up to.</p>

<p>He found the scientist talking with Jessie, James, and Meowth about the results of testing done on prototype plasteel weapons devised from the stolen schematics. Archer joined the conversation, interested for an update.</p>

<p>"Looks like everything's been going well," James summarized the discussion. "The laser rifles work, the laser gatling guns work; about the only thing that's fucked up is the laser sword."</p>

<p>"Why is the sword fucked up?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>Colress adjusted his eyeglasses and explained in more detail. "Igniting the energy beam causes a forward burst of kinetic energy far greater than an average weapon's recoil, which can cause the user to lose their footing and accidentally strike themselves with the ray, to say nothing of the manual difficulty in wielding such an apparatus afterwards."</p>

<p>"So... what you're saying is we should spend our resources making the kick-ass rifles and gatling guns, and forego the swords. That's cool," Archer decided. "I'll inform Giovanni. He'll probably want to start munitions production as soon as possible."</p>

<p>All effort was hereby focused on making these weapons, an effort which James, Jessie, and Meowth commandeered with gusto. The weapons produced from this effort would be moved out of the camp.</p>

<p>"...to the oil rig?" Archer questioned dubiously when he'd first heard of the plan. "We'd be making three times the effort."</p>

<p>"For four times the payoff." Giovanni was already decided in this. "The oil rig is harder to reach, being isolated in the sea, and whenever our enemies have tried to attack us they come by land. The plasteel weapons should be safer out there until we have a sufficient stockpile for our use."</p>

<p>So it was that the first batch of weapons were moved out to the oil rig, a total of about ten prototype plasteel rifles, which were flown over during the night.</p>

<p>Archer meanwhile was tasked with organizing the hunting parties that routinely went out around noon. These were meant to catch wild Pokémon to be sold back on the mainland, yet they served a second purpose, which was patrolling the outlying woodland for any sign of their enemies.</p>

<p>As he and his little group set out for the woods that day, he caught sight of James and Jessie helping transport a crate of newly-crafted plasteel blocks from one side of the encampment to the other, with a supervising Meowth padding behind them and occasionally yowling some critique. Archer held himself back from some tongue-in-cheek comment.</p>

<p>At least if he had to be assigned somewhere other than the conquest of towns, it was to go hunting. There was only so much of the mundane Archer personally could stand at their encampment, of watching buildings being constructed and plasteel being crafted, before he got fed up and wanted some action. To him the charm of their activities on Palpagos Island was, ironically, the warfare; the vengeful impunity of shooting enemies with his trusty Pokémon by his side. Not having to play around laws like Team Rocket might have to do in a more civilized region meant they could be as vicious as they wanted to be here. The day-to-day monotony of materiel production was secondary entertainment at best and a boring necessity at worst.</p>

<p>That said, he knew the trio rather enjoyed the relative peace and quiet here at the encampment. <i>To each his own,</i> he figured.</p>

<p>Archer motioned to his hunting party, and they headed out.</p>

<p>All things considered, their hunting expedition started out smoothly. They followed the main trail out of the encampment, but soon veered off the path into the ferns and brambles where the wildlife might better conceal itself.</p>

<p>They hadn't gone very far into the forest before they spied their first Pal along the side of a thicket.</p>

<p>It looked like an autumn-coat Deerling, but it had a long bushy tail and a tuft of flame on its forehead. It was standing below a young tree, gnawing on small, low-hanging branches it was blackening with the low embers of its breath.</p>

<p>"We call that kind of Pal a Rooby," Zoe told him.</p>

<p>"All right," said Archer, readying a Poké Ball to throw, "that one, Frostallion. Try to weaken it."</p>

<p>Frostallion neighed and unleashed a powerful scythe of ice. The Rooby bounded away and the attack instead knocked squarely into the tree, which creaked and tumbled backwards. It crashed loudly into the bushes.</p>

<p>Frostallion looked ready to race into battle, but to its chagrin Archer held it back. "You battle instead," he ordered one of the minions, who dutifully sent out a Raticate.</p>

<p>The large rodent sprang at the deer, which swatted it back with a sharp burst of flame. Their sparring went on for about a minute before the Rooby had been sufficiently tired out, and a Poké Ball was flung at it; the sphere shook once or twice but marked a successful capture.</p>

<p>As the minion stepped forward to collect the Poké Ball, Archer was busy scowling at the fallen tree. He looked back at Frostallion, which had straightened its posture with undeniable pride in its power. "Okay, I know you've got a war-horse's pedigree, but we're going to have to practice measuring the strength of your attacks; otherwise I'll never be able to enter you in sporting battles. An attack that unrestrained might've killed the damn thing."</p>

<p>Frostallion snorted in reply.</p>

<p>"You might be good to take along on Team Rocket hits, though," Archer considered casually, which seemed to cheer up the horse. It began prancing about and shaking its icy mane.</p>

<p>As the afternoon progressed they managed to catch several species; some that Archer had seen before, and some new ones that he wasn't quite sure of – save for his usual summation of the creature by those traits he could find a mainland comparison to – but all of which Zoe was readily able to identify for him as per the island lingo.</p>

<p>The forest was calm as ever, and sunlight stretched beautiful warm rays through the leaves. As they wandered through the woods in search of wildlife, they came across a treasure chest lying in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Houndoom, which Archer had sent out in lieu of Frostallion, got one look at the treasure chest and started barking at it.</p>

<p>"What the fuck is this?" asked one of the Team Rocket grunts, standing over the chest. It looked like it was made of some kind of ivory bearing a strange bronze sheen, its outline etched in the same blue hues of raw tumblestone. Most unique of all, two triangular protrusions rose from the top of the lid, seemingly resembling an animal's ears.</p>

<p>"This looks expensive," added a second minion, joining the first. "Or old. Or both."</p>

<p>"I think the word you're looking for is <i>antique</i>...?"</p>

<p>One of the other minions was poking it with a stick. "I bet some pirates left gold in that."</p>

<p>"You got one hell of an imagination, Jeanne."</p>

<p>"Well, what would you put in there? It's obviously a treasure chest."</p>

<p>Archer gave it a skeptical look. "Or it could be a mine," he pointed out dryly.</p>

<p>This did not dissuade the minions in the slightest. "There doesn't seem to be a lock on it," said one.</p>

<p>"Hey, Harold? See if you can whack it open."</p>

<p>This seemed to put Houndoom on high alert, and suddenly the Pokémon sprang in front of the chest growling to bar their way to it. A few of the minions stepped back nervously.</p>

<p>"Um... Archer. What's with your Houndoom?"</p>

<p>"I don't think Houndoom wants you people hitting that thing."</p>

<p>"Why? It's just an old chest of some kind."</p>

<p>"Or...it could be a fucking <i>mine</i>," Archer said with emphasis, "which the enemy put there knowing you're a bunch of imbeciles who'd try to open the damn thing."</p>

<p>Zoe wandered over. "That's a Mimog."</p>

<p>"What the hell is a Mimog?"</p>

<p>She placed some berries in front of it and motioned to them to retreat a short distance into the bushes.</p>

<p>They waited patiently. Sure enough the chest cracked open slightly, and then it seemed to spring to life, pulling little brown paws out from underneath itself as well as a matching, wagging tail. From inside both halves of its shell came a long tongue, with which it lapped up the berries with glee, and then tucked its paws and tail back inside and settled down again. The 'lid' of the treasure chest closed once more.</p>

<p>Archer turned to face Zoe. "Don't tell me. Just like we have land-sharks, this is a land-Shellder."</p>

<p>"They act more like little dogs," she said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"If you say so."</p>

<p>"They don't hurt anything. In fact, Mimog rarely even want to battle...they try to run first," Zoe explained.</p>

<p>He was debating the merits of throwing a Poké Ball at it versus laying a trail of berries back to the base, or whether they even needed one of these Mimogs at all, when he heard shooting from over the slope and turned sharply. "What was that?" and then, more urgently, "Where's Ray?"</p>

<p>One of the Team Rocket grunts was indeed missing, the one who had aided in catching the Rooby earlier. With realization, Archer darted out of the bushes towards the hill with Zoe and the others following him closely.</p>

<p>They reached the top of the hill in time to see what transpired; there was a battle between a group of at least ten trainers and their missing minion, which had culminated in one of the former pulling out a gun and shooting the latter dead.</p>

<p>His Raticate angled an ear back and, seeing its trainer fall to the ground, abandoned the fight in an attempt to flee. One of the others gave a shout, and an electric type creature – something like a small fairy wreathed in a misty grey thundercloud – attacked with a burst of electricity. Seized with paralysis the Raticate slumped to the grass, shivering.</p>

<p>Sheltered behind the cloak of bracken and trees, Archer, Zoe, and the rest of the hunting party watched every move of their enemies below. Interestingly enough, none of the trainers below wore the uniforms of PIDF infantrymen.</p>

<p>"Mercenaries no doubt," said Zoe, "there are always Pal tamers on Palpagos Island who seek fortune and can be hired."</p>

<p>"They're going to get more than they bargained for," Archer muttered as he watched them push the paralyzed Raticate into a cage. They took it with them as they proceeded down the road, unaware of their observers.</p>

<p>"Zoe, you and the others take Ray's body and head back to our encampment," Archer instructed, "Tell Giovanni what has happened. I'm going to follow those assholes and learn where their hideout is."</p>

<p>His Houndoom trotted along with him at his heels. The dog was as furtive as its trainer, bearing a natural subtlety inherent in all dark type Pokémon; it knew innately how to hide in the shadows. They trailed their enemies all the way to a sprawling meadow beside a creek, where a campsite had been set up.</p>

<p>Archer lingered at the boulders and tree-line, observing the activity below. It reminded him somewhat of the Syndicate's old encampment near their tower, with a campfire in the center and tents scattered about. These tents, however, were of a decidedly new fabric, and nothing there looked handmade but instead of the finest quality camping materials brought direct from the mainland regions.</p>

<p>The mercenary trainers entered the encampment, placing the cage with the stolen Raticate down on the grass. The scent of a stew wafted over from where a cooking pot was suspended over the campfire, and Archer could see other trainers in civilian garb who were lingering around the fire impatient for mealtime. Several Pals were also in the camp, protecting the area. Everyone gathered there looked like seasoned trainers and all the Pokémon they had out of their spheres looked to be at very high levels.</p>

<p>Marcus was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Archer had about decided to head back to tell Giovanni where they were so they could launch an attack, when inexplicably he felt a chill like ice race up his spine.</p>

<p>Beside him, Houndoom had started growling. He did little more than turn and found himself surrounded by three strange creatures.</p>

<p>He didn't even quite know how to describe them – they were black, owl-like creatures, but seemed to have no feathers. They had a shell-like covering on their face similar to a Yamask and a slight sheen of energy that made him guess they must likewise be ghost types, but he wasn't sure.</p>

<p>For a moment Archer merely faced the creatures, which stared back at him with intentions concealed. Before he could make a move, they attacked.</p>

<p>Archer decided they were definitely related to Yamask. Their manner of attack was equal to the ghost type's evolution, but their form was even more grotesque. In the manner of a ghost Pokémon, or even a bug Pokémon, they suddenly produced many tendrils seemingly from nowhere and lashed at him with pincers, while their facial covering morphed into a crescent of pointed teeth. They sprang, snapping at him, while Archer had to jump back to avoid the monstrous beasts that were now howling as a group.</p>

<p>Without waiting for Archer's command, Houndoom unleashed an Inferno attack that spread outwards from its paws in a rush of fire. It hit against all three of the creatures at once; they backed away a short distance and redirected their attention away from Archer and onto Houndoom.</p>

<p>The commotion drew the attention of the enemy camp. Archer could hear orders being shouted, mostly in the island language, and running footsteps alongside weapons being loaded.</p>

<p><i>These damned things must have been sent by them to guard the forest perimeter,</i> Archer thought, seeing how the ghostly creatures now spread out as if they were less interested in fighting him per se and more in preventing his escape.</p>

<p>Houndoom shot a second volley of fire at the Pals, causing them to bound out of the way before retaliating with their garish attacks. Archer could see how his Pokémon was faltering under the onslaught, and in a swift movement he was able to recall Houndoom to its Poké Ball and send out Frostallion.</p>

<p>"All right Frostallion," Archer ordered, "remember how I was telling you to restrain your power? That goes out the window here! Hit as hard as you can."</p>

<p>The Pegasus took one look at its multiple opponents and reared up whinnying, emboldened by the challenge. It raced forwards with ice on its outstretched wings, catching three of the ghost Pals and hurling them against the tree trunks before they could teleport away. One tried to bite, only to get kicked by Frostallion and fall with a whimper to the ground.</p>

<p>Archer meanwhile was marvelling at Frostallion's power and reminding himself that for all the Pal looked like an icy Rapidash with wings, it was classed as a Legendary here and had the strength that came with it. <i>This must be the kind of fun Kris has commanding her Suicune,</i> he reflected.</p>

<p>Within less than a minute the enemy creatures had been defeated. The mercenaries, who had come rushing over ready to fight, were now having second thoughts about their next actions – especially when Archer swung about towards them and Frostallion responded to the implicit order. It shot a single Ice Beam into the crowd, throwing them in disarray. One man was struck headlong with the attack and tumbled to the ground in a cloud of frost and ice, and Archer immediately snatched up the gun he'd held, and noticed the dead man was the same one who had killed Ray. "Divine justice," he said out loud.</p>

<p>Archer turned quickly to face the others but before he could shoot any of them, they threw up their hands disarmingly.</p>

<p>"Spare us! The PIDF put us up to this," one of them implored. "They offered us a good sum of gold if we could get rid of the outsiders."</p>

<p>"...you didn't spare Ray back there," Archer replied dryly.</p>

<p>"We'll give back the Pal we took and tell you everything we know."</p>

<p>For the moment at least, Archer decided to humor them, especially considering Team Rocket <i>did</i> lack information on the PIDF's movements and any bit of intelligence on that front would help. Frostallion looked eager to flatten the lot of them under a barrage of its ice attacks but instead it obediently paced back and forth, its wings flared as a threat, ensuring no one there tried anything.</p>

<p><i>So far, so good,</i> thought Archer, who recalled the stolen Raticate to its Poké Ball as the cage was brought forth. He turned back towards the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Where is Marcus Dryden?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On his way with his army to raid your group."</p>

<p>Archer smirked. "He ought to know by now that our camp is too heavily guarded."</p>

<p>"Not the camp, the oil rig."</p>

<p>"The oil rig?"</p>

<p>"He spoke of weapons your group has made, which he wanted to steal," the mercenary said. "He knows these items were moved from your camp last night because he sent scouts to spy. He also knows that your leader Giovanni will be going on the oil rig today and plans to coincide with him there."</p>

<p><i>Fuck,</i> thought Archer, <i>If this is true, I've got to get back and let everyone know – fast.</i></p>

<h2>Chapter 26 - Oil Rig Assault ✅</h2>

<p>Archer raced towards the camp on Frostallion, as quick as he could, hoping to get there before Giovanni departed. When he got there, he first encountered Zoe.</p>

<p>"Archer, thank God you're back. I was worried," said Zoe, as he drew the horse to an abrupt halt before her.</p>

<p>"No need. Frostallion singlehandedly flattened all their Pokémon...or is it single-hoofed? Anyway, we got the Raticate back. Where's Giovanni?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By the time we got here he'd left for the oil rig," she replied. "James, Jessie, and Meowth went with him...I think your sister Kris did, as well."</p>

<p>"Damn it," Archer cursed. He surveyed the encampment swiftly; there were sufficient guards, however there were less than usual, and the squadrons that had been sent out to seize the towns had not returned yet. "...and this makes it even worse! We've only got about enough people here to defend the camp, not to come along with us for a counter-offensive."</p>

<p>Zoe blinked with confusion. "What's going on?"</p>

<p>"Marcus is planning to attack the oil rig," Archer related the information in a hurry. "He's taking the bulk of his army to try to raid the platform and steal the plasteel weapons we've got stashed there."</p>

<p>"The oil rig? But I thought that place was a floating fortress. Won't it be a losing battle?"</p>

<p>"Not if he has a strategy planned out, and from the sound of things he does. There's no time to waste," Archer declared. "If I get there fast enough, maybe I can warn Giovanni."</p>

<p>"I'm coming too," she told him, pulling herself up on Frostallion's back to sit behind Archer.</p>

<p>He started to protest, yet she was adamant.</p>

<p>"In case you <i>don't</i> get there fast enough," Zoe explained, "my Pals and I can help you as backup."</p>

<p>Archer gave a sharp nod; it made sense. "Frostallion, towards the seashore," he directed, and Frostallion, with a reciprocating neigh, stretched its broad wings and took flight.</p><hr>

<p>If there was any outcome of Team Rocket's arrival that was truly a testament to both modern engineering and their undying quest for profit, it was their offshore oil rig.</p>

<p>Far enough from the island that it could not disturb any beach-goers, close enough that it could be seen like a figment upon the waves, it was in many ways the crowning glory of their regional conquest. They'd devised a fully functional structure in days that commonly took months to build, thanks to the fact Giovanni spared no expense in what he felt would be a profitable investment.</p>

<p>Archer and Zoe rode on Frostallion all the way over to the oil rig. As they were nearing the platform, they could see the deck sprawling before them with the massive derrick rising high, as well as two laser turrets that had been added on either end of the structure since they'd started manufacturing plasteel – they weren't strong enough to kill, but they'd give any unwanted visitors enough burns to make them second-guess their intrusion. A heliport on the far side accommodated either Giovanni's helicopter or a larger one to shuttle any workers who didn't have flying Pokémon to and from the island.</p>

<p>They also saw the cause of the distant glow and noise; everyone below was engaged in combat, with several Pokémon in the middle of a fight and people shooting at each other.</p>

<p>Frostallion whinnied and Archer looked up in time to see one of their own laser turrets charging and pointed at them.</p>

<p>"Down!" he cried, and the horse narrowly flew towards the sea as the laser blasted overhead trying to strike them. They crashed into the water, and Frostallion neighed a protest.</p>

<p>"Those bastards took over our own security system," scowled Archer, returning Frostallion to its Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"How are we going to get over there?" asked Zoe.</p>

<p>Archer evaluated the oil rig. From here they could hear the sounds of war on the deck yet no one seemed to realize they were in the water right below, wading about the massive pillars that held up the platform.</p>

<p>In the midst of him weighing a strategy, there was a sudden flash of light and what should appear by them but several Unowns. They squeaked a greeting to the couple.</p>

<p>Archer stared in surprise. "The Unowns? Why are you...no, nevermind..." he decided, and pointed up to the oil rig platform. "Can you get us up there?"</p>

<p>The Unowns squeaked again and, surrounding Archer and Zoe, instantly teleported them up to the platform.</p>

<p>As he'd expected – Marcus' PIDF forces. No sooner had Archer and Zoe warped there did one of the enemy soldiers notice them, and Archer in turn spied him right when he was aiming his rifle.</p>

<p>Archer pulled Zoe to the ground and she gasped as gunfire pelted the metal wall behind them. He opened a Poké Ball and sent out Houndoom.</p>

<p>"Faint Attack!" he cried, and Houndoom leapt with a snarl at the man. The dog tackled him backwards in a bright flare of violet energy, knocking the weapon from his hands.</p>

<p>The soldier's shout drew the attention of his comrades; Archer grabbed the whip from his belt right as Zoe sent out her Grizzbolt. At a single motion from Zoe, Grizzbolt sent forth a powerful barrage of electricity, while Archer struck out with his whip at the nearest enemy as he lifted a gun to fire at them. The lash cut across the soldier's face and caused him to misfire.</p>

<p>It provided enough of a commotion that Archer and Zoe were able to duck for cover behind a storage shed. Grizzbolt and Houndoom stood alongside each other, fighting together with the perfectly timed attacks one might see in a double battle on the mainland, albeit with more ferocity. In between electric bolts and fiery waves the two animals were able to keep all the enemy soldiers at bay.</p>

<p>A familiar sound caught their ears; the screech of a hawk. Archer first saw the streak of fire sweep past the derrick, and then as he followed its flight he was able to discern exactly what – who – it was.</p>

<p>It was Marcus Dryden, who was sitting astride his Faleris as they oversaw the battle from mid-air.</p>

<p><i>Looks like the colonel's here to command his army personally this time,</i> thought Archer.</p>

<p>At any other time this would have filled him with a surge of excitement for the battle; now it only made him uneasy. There were so <i>many</i> enemies here, Archer imagined it must be the PIDF's entire army that had been sent to rid the island of them once and for all. Even with their own united numbers of both Team Rocket and Syndicate members, they seemed to be evenly matched at best.</p>

<p>Archer was starting to think that having asked the Unown to teleport him and Zoe up here was a bad idea. He'd initially wanted to reclaim the laser turrets, and then find Giovanni; his plans were quickly being shelved in favor of survival. They were being swamped.</p>

<p>"Suicune, Bubble Beam!"</p>

<p>He recognized his sister's voice right as a powerful stream of bubbles shot past, which collided with one of the enemy soldiers and knocked him off his feet.</p>

<p>He turned to see Kris running towards them with her Suicune. Suicune roared and sent forth another current of bubbles to push back the enemy soldiers as Kris reached his and Zoe's side.</p>

<p>"Need some help?" she smiled.</p>

<p>"Kris, thank God!" he exclaimed, "I've never been happier to see you and that Suicune of yours. Where's Giovanni?"</p>

<p>"He went to the chopper. You need to find Jessie and James; Giovanni sent them to defend our munitions stockpile, but there are so many invaders they're probably going to need help to chase them off. Meowth went to hit some kind of emergency button in the control room that shuts off the oil extraction, so that any fires up here won't reach the oil well and explode this whole place." She  turned back to command her Pokémon on the battlefield. "Keep up the Bubble Beams, Suicune!"</p>

<p>Archer motioned to Zoe for her to follow him, and they recalled their Pokémon leaving the battle to Kris' Suicune while they made their way across the platform, keeping low behind the storage containers and evading gunfire when they were forced to dart into the open.</p>

<p>"The munitions chest is across from the heliport," Archer said, as they hid behind a stack of big industrial pipes, "We'll get there faster if we get up the stairwell to the uppermost level, and then skip across the tops of the storage containers there."</p>

<p>The stairwell in question was currently blocked by a group of battling Pals, a Direhowl against three Leezpunk; meanwhile their trainers, apparently having run out of bullets, were now grappling with each other using their fists. It was the energy blasts Archer was most worried about getting struck by; every time one of the animals dodged an attack, the flare would sear past and strike whatever happened to be behind them.</p>

<p>Archer grabbed Zoe's hand and they made a run for it right as the Direhowl tackled one of the Leezpunk and the other two sprang onto its back, and they managed to get past unnoticed and then race up the steps.</p>

<p>They emerged to the top level of the oil rig platform to find this area also in the midst of war. The stairwell opened out with a clear view of the heliport, but Giovanni's aircraft was nowhere to be seen as Archer and Zoe swiftly crossed over a railing and descended the nearby stack of storage containers. Part of the paramilitary training Team Rocket's admins went through taught them to leap skillfully across barriers in a gymnastic way like parkour, so for Archer this was second nature, but even considering Zoe's training had not delved so far she was surprisingly light on her feet and kept up with him easily.</p>

<p>Reaching the bottom row, Archer heard an explosion; he turned towards the sound and quickly spied Jessie and James.</p>

<p>They were poised on top of a shipping container, holding a bazooka on their shoulders. The explosion had come from the couple firing their weapon on a group of invaders who had, apparently without much forethought, thought they could rush them.</p>

<p>As he watched, he saw a flash of cream fur zip across the deck towards them; it was Meowth, who'd apparently been successful in his mission to hit the emergency cut-off button. The cat was running as fast as he could on all fours, and when he reached the edge of the blast area, he took a leap to clear the debris and landed right at James and Jessie's heels.</p>

<p>Archer and Zoe wove through the fray and joined the trio. "Archer, Zoe, we didn't expect to see you two here," Jessie remarked. "What, not enough excitement back at the camp?"</p>

<p>"We saw something was going on from the seashore and came flying over to see," explained Zoe.</p>

<p>"How did these people get aboard?" Archer asked.</p>

<p>"Overnight," replied James. "Apparently they used water Pokémon to swim across and grappling guns to rappel up here."</p>

<p>Meowth chimed in indignantly, "The dimwits who were supposed to be keepin' lookout at the laser guns decided to take a catnap on the job. The boss was really pissed when he was boarding the chopper and told us to dismiss 'em both as possible spies."</p>

<p>"We've dealt with it already," said Jessie simply.</p>

<p>Archer gave a brisk nod as he surveyed the platform before them. They appeared to be making some headway, at least on this part of the oil rig, but he could see another wave of enemies fighting across the way and trying to advance. "Besides stealing our new weapons, what is it they want? To explode the rig or capture it?"</p>

<p>"At this point, we think they just want to take it. If they'd wanted to blow the place up, they'd probably have bombs going off by now," said James.</p>

<p>Jessie, meanwhile, had been checking their provisions. "James, we're running out of ammo."</p>

<p>"Already...? Shit," he muttered.</p>

<p>Archer looked at them dumbfounded. "You've got a fucking munitions chest right there."</p>

<p>Meowth yowled. "Where'd ya think we got the rockets for our bazooka from?"</p>

<p>A screech split the air, and they looked up to see Marcus and Faleris had flown nearer to where they were. The large hawk had unleashed a Fire Spin attack; the whirlwind of fire had slammed directly into some smaller Pokémon trying to keep it at bay, and hurled them along with one of their trainers into the ocean below. The man screamed as he plummeted off of the oil rig.</p>

<p>"He's pretty bold coming out here himself," commented Jessie as they watched him circle around to assail the other trainers.</p>

<p>"Not bold; he just knows he can't be hit," said Archer.</p>

<p>Zoe elaborated, "Marcus has got some kind of a barrier that makes him impervious to attack."</p>

<p>"You mean his Faleris knows Protect," said James.</p>

<p>"No," Archer told them, "it looks like some sort of artificial Protect barrier, like the ones used at stadiums to protect the audience from stray Pokémon attacks. I've had clear shots of the bastard the past couple of times I've faced him in battle and haven't been able to break through it."</p>

<p>Jessie narrowed her eyes. "If it's an artificial shield, then all we have to do is get it away from him."</p>

<p>She motioned to James and Meowth, and they lifted the bazooka back onto their shoulders. The trio shot directly at Faleris.</p>

<p>Clouds of fire roared outwards in the impulse, yet Archer could make out the energy shield that glittered around Marcus to protect him from the blast, a honeycomb barrier shimmering in shades of gold.</p>

<p>The explosion pushed Faleris backwards. Marcus nearly lost his grip on the hawk; while trying to regain his balance, he dropped the shield device he'd had clipped to his vest pocket.</p>

<p>It was a small device, no bigger than the transceivers used as cell phones on the mainland. Before Marcus could snatch the shield back up from the ground, Meowth sprang to destroy it with a powerful swipe of claws. The cat's attack sheared the device in half.</p>

<p>Irate, Marcus redirected Faleris with a gesture to attack Meowth. As Faleris swooped down to strike with its talons, Meowth raced agilely out of the way; James and Jessie meanwhile tossed Poké Balls to send out their other two Pokémon, Arbok and Weezing, shouting orders to attack the bird.</p>

<p>While Marcus was contending with Jessie, James, and Meowth – and failing miserably in the endeavor – Archer sprang down to where the munitions chest was. Zoe joined him.</p>

<p>To think they'd thought the oil rig would be a good place to stash their plasteel weapons. They'd imagined the encampment would be raided, never this stronghold. In retrospect it had been shortsighted.</p>

<p>They only had a few working prototypes thus far; Archer flung open the chest lid and retrieved one of the laser rifles. It was a rectangular contrivance that looked objectively bulky to hold, yet it was surprisingly lightweight and the energy cartridges it used for ammunition snapped in smoothly.</p>

<p>"What better time to try this out," decided Archer, spinning around to face the oncoming onslaught of PIDF soldiers.</p>

<p>He aimed the rifle and fired. Bursts of orange light streaked outward in straight lines, hitting their enemies; it burnt straight through their armor, and they shouted as they collapsed. The animals advancing with them lingered back a distance to see this, but they fired their own energy attacks in response anyway. Archer pulled Zoe aside as brilliantly colored flares slashed past them and they flung out Poké Balls, summoning Houndoom and Grizzbolt again to battle. Houndoom's Protect shielded them from gunfire as Grizzbolt swatted one of the opponent Pals away, where it hit against one of the shipping containers and was immediately knocked out.</p>

<p>For a time, Archer and Zoe had gotten the advantage. At a distance, they could see James, Jessie, and Meowth at a stalemate against Marcus and Faleris; Arbok and Weezing's attacks were striking their mark, yet the colonel and his Pal were too strong for them to measurably weaken him, and Jessie and James were swift to recall their Pokémon whenever they were going to be hit directly in retaliation. Archer was planning to turn the laser rifle on Marcus as soon as they could beat their enemies back.</p>

<p>His plan was discarded when they ran out of energy cartridges for the laser rifle and were once again surrounded.</p>

<p>There were simply far too many of them to contend with, even with their own Pokémon trying to fight back. Archer stepped back apprehensively, cornered with the munitions chest behind him.</p>

<p>The sound of rotors slicing through the air made everyone turn to see the helicopter rising overhead, hovering above them with menace.</p>

<p>Archer smiled with dark knowledge.</p>

<p>Peering out of the helicopter's passenger window, Persian let out a hiss. His trainer Giovanni glanced nonchalantly at the pilot.</p>

<p>"Charge the cannons. Let's see what it can do."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said the pilot firmly.</p>

<p>The laser flashed across the deck.</p>

<p>Archer had to shut his eyes from the glare. Heat blasted across his face; when the loud screech of the laser receded and he opened his eyes, all the enemies had been obliterated into ashes.</p>

<p>In the helicopter overhead, Giovanni grinned as he witnessed this and addressed the cat on his lap. "Five times as strong as a Hyper Beam. I think it's worth keeping…don't you agree, Persian?"</p>

<p>Persian purred.</p><hr>

<p>Many on the ground had seen what Giovanni's helicopter was capable of. So had Marcus, who immediately directed his Pal's attention to a new target.</p>

<p>"Faleris, let's see what damage that combat helicopter can sustain. Aim for the tail rotor!"</p>

<p>Faleris dutifully obeyed and flew directly toward the helicopter, releasing a burst of fire as it swept past. The blast struck the tail rotor with such intensity that the boom sheared off and the helicopter lurched back.</p>

<p>Inside, Persian let out a caterwaul as Giovanni grabbed hold of his seat, the force of gravity pulling them hard to the side. The pilot scrambled to try to regain control of the aircraft, but wasn't fast enough before it twirled out of control.</p>

<p>Archer had turned away from the battle just in time to see the helicopter spinning violently in a wild, diagonal descent, a spectacle that ended when it crashed into the ocean and exploded.</p>

<p>He was stunned for a moment, and then he caught sight of Marcus flying overhead on Faleris, the spectre of mirth on his lips; any astonishment fled Archer at once and was supplanted by rage and vengeful hatred. The mere thought of his godfather Giovanni dying such a horrible, fiery death...!</p>

<p>"You bastard! You will pay for this!" he yelled at the top of his lungs, and sent out Frostallion.</p>

<p>"Archer – wait!" James said, but Archer had already mounted the horse and taken flight.</p>

<p>Marcus had turned Faleris about and was flying away from the oil rig and the helicopter's fiery wreckage, back towards Palpagos Island.</p>

<p><i>The asshole probably figures he got what he came for,</i> Archer thought, <i>Most likely he thinks that if Giovanni is dead, we'll back down. Clearly he doesn't realize how we operate... He owes me and Team Rocket now more than ever, and payment is overdue.</i></p><h2>Chapter 27 - Ultimate Weapon ✅</h2>

<p>Frostallion galloped over the ocean at Archer's behest, coursing on the sea wind like if it were a racetrack. Up ahead, Archer could see Marcus flying directly towards the island shore on Faleris' back.</p>

<p>"You think I'm letting you get away that easy, you asshole?" Archer muttered. He certainly wouldn't permit it; not after Marcus had killed his godfather. He was going to settle accounts once and for all.</p>

<p>As he neared his enemy, Archer had already planned out a battle strategy and had concluded the odds of victory as being greatly in his favor. Faleris was a bird; all flying types were weak to ice.</p>

<p>"Ice Beam," he commanded.</p>

<p>Frostallion opened its mouth and sent forth a frozen blast, which struck Faleris squarely across the wing.</p>

<p>The ice beam seemed to have no effect. The large hawk shook off the attack like snowfall and Marcus locked eyes with Archer.</p>

<p><i>Faleris must be a pure fire type,</i> Archer realized with dread, <i>…and that means we're the ones weak to it.</i></p>

<p>Marcus swung his arm upward, and Faleris immediately spun around to unleash a torrent of fire towards the ocean.</p>

<p>The water erupted into steam.</p>

<p>Frostallion whinnied and reared in mid-air. Archer searched the cloud desperately and reacted too late when he at last saw the outline of his foe in the mist.</p>

<p>Screeching a war-cry, Faleris struck out viciously with its talons as Archer nearly toppled from his mount; Frostallion struck back with its hooves and beating wings while Archer scrambled to keep hold of the horse's reins.</p>

<p>The whole world had become a tumult; sky and wind and water and feathers, all conspiring to cast him to his doom. He swung out with the whip, first once, then twice, and succeeded in entangling one of Faleris' legs in the lash.</p>

<p>Now it was Marcus' turn to struggle. Faleris squawked in protest, its wings flapping in an aimless and frantic attempt to get away; Frostallion tugged backward as Archer held on vengefully, putting all the effort his muscles could muster into not letting go.</p>

<p>When he saw Marcus pull out his revolver, Archer ducked against Frostallion's back. One gunshot rang out over him, then a second, then a third, then a fourth. Despite being so near to his target, Marcus could not get clear aim because of his own mount's desperation to get loose from where it was currently tangled.</p>

<p><i>He's only got two rounds left,</i> Archer was thinking, the sound from the last shot still ringing in his ears from proximity.</p>

<p>The two creatures and their riders grappled futilely till at last exhaustion won out; Faleris collapsed onto the ground of Palpagos Island below. They had ended up in the ancient, forgotten city on the Astral Mountains.</p>

<p>Frostallion landed only a short distance away, still able to battle but just barely. The horse was heaving for breath as Archer watched his opponent like a wolf about to pounce, just waiting for Marcus to make a move.</p>

<p>When he didn't, evidently unsure how to either escape or regain the advantage, Archer got tired of waiting.</p>

<p>"Trample him into the ground, Frostallion," Archer ordered, as he whipped the reins for the horse to attack Marcus.</p>

<p>Marcus dove sideways as Frostallion forward, and the creature stumbled into a cluster of the red flowers and their dewy vines.</p>

<p>Archer tried to turn the horse to attack again, however the plants appeared to have a different idea. The vines had somehow wrapped themselves around Frostallion's hooves and inexplicably the fine dew they were covered in had become as unrelenting as glue.</p>

<p>Frostallion neighed and tried to lift into the air with its wings, but the vines entangled themselves further, almost as if they were actively trying to prevent it from fleeing, which only led to the horse getting frantic till Archer could calm it down.</p>

<p>Marcus took advantage of the distraction; he recalled Faleris to its Pal Sphere and ran away.</p>

<p>"You think this is over?" shouted Archer at his escaping enemy, "You owe Team Rocket, and we <i>never write off debts</i>."</p>

<p>He had to get down from the horse in order to untangle its hooves from the vines. The tendrils were surprisingly stubborn, and Archer was thankful they were all relatively young plants because they were small enough to rip through. <i>With how tenacious these things are, I'd sure hate it if we'd stumbled into one of the bigger plants,</i> Archer thought.</p>

<p>He flew back to the oil rig, mortified at how Marcus had gotten away from him and vowing to get revenge. It was only now that the magnitude of the helicopter crash was starting to sink in, and he felt miserable. What would become of Team Rocket without Giovanni?</p>

<p>His worries turned out for naught when he arrived and found his godfather on the platform with his Persian, entirely unharmed. He was accompanied by Jessie and James.</p>

<p>"Giovanni – you're okay! But how? I saw the helicopter explode!" Archer exclaimed with astonishment.</p>

<p>"The Unown appeared in the helicopter," Giovanni explained, "and teleported me, Persian, and the pilot down to safety."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he glanced over and Archer followed his gaze to see a cluster of happy Unowns nearby squeaking and twirling about.</p>

<p>"I gave chase after Marcus," Archer told him, "but Frostallion got caught in tendrils of those damn flower plants and the son of a bitch ran off!"</p>

<p>"We'll get him," Giovanni said confidently, "It's just a matter of time."</p>

<p>Archer looked around and said, "I see you eradicated everybody sent to attack us."</p>

<p>"We have another situation to deal with," Jessie spoke up. "All the prototype plasteel weapons were stolen in that battle."</p>

<p>Archer turned towards her with surprise. "How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"Distraction as a strategy," said James. "While our people were in battle, a select group stole them."</p>

<p>Giovanni frowned. "It was brilliantly executed, quite frankly." He faced Archer and added, "After you rest a bit from your ordeal, come to my office and give me a full report of what happened with Marcus. We need to start tracking him as soon as possible."</p>

<p>He turned and left, with Persian following. Archer looked around to the others, and just then noticed their ever-present cat was missing. "Where's Meowth?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Chatting with a Wooloo that defected," James replied.</p>

<p>"We have a defector?"</p>

<p>Meowth trotted over at that moment, accompanied by a round little sheep that looked intimidated by all the eyes now on it.</p>

<p>"Lamball here says they gots info on the PIDF's plans," Meowth yowled.</p>

<p>"Hopefully it's not a trick," Archer replied.</p>

<p>Meowth hissed at him. "Pokémon don't lie about this shit, unless we gots a good reason."</p>

<p>"But do Pals?" Archer prodded cynically. "If you'll forgive me from being skeptical, but I'm still sore about getting backstabbed by a monkey."</p>

<p>"<i>Ffftt</i>. That was a monkey. This is a sheep. And I'm a cat, so I'm perceptive."</p>

<p>"Okay, whatever," Jessie dismissed Archer's concerns with a wave as she turned back to the Lamball. "What've you got?"</p>

<p>"Marcus has what he feels is the ultimate weapon," the cat translated, "in addition to the Essence Condenser."</p>

<p>"Was the Pal Essence Condenser what Marcus had trapped the Unowns in?" James asked.</p>

<p>Archer jumped into the conversation. "Yeah, he said he was using it to draw energy from Pokémon and use it to power his ultimate weapon. The consensus was he wanted to increase Faleris' level that way. Probably a moot point now, since the Condenser has been destroyed."</p>

<p>"Lamball says that Marcus already did it," said Meowth, as the sheep went on bleating, "but it's not Faleris he wanted to make stronger. You're not going to believe what his so-called ultimate weapon is."</p>

<p>Jessie crossed her arms. "Try us."</p>

<p>"Little red flowers."</p>

<p>They all stared in confusion at the two animals, whereupon the Lamball tried to elaborate, and Meowth translated:</p>

<p>"Except when he zapped them with the energy he siphoned off all those Pokémon, they started growing into <i>giant</i> red flowers. He's planning to use 'em as his secret to victory. By the way, Marcus isn't on the island anymore."</p>

<p>"He's not?" Jessie asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"His plan was to swipe our plasteel lasers and fly directly to the Kalos region," the cat growled, "He thinks the plants over there should've grown big enough by this time to accomplish what he set out to do."</p>

<p>"I can't be the only one who doesn't understand what's the big deal with these plants. So what if they grow big? What does he expect, for them to overtake the city? or for all the Pokémon on the mainland to get ill from them? They're plants." Archer questioned.</p>

<p>"They're plants that eat things," the cat meowed.</p>

<p>"Are you saying they're carnivorous?" James asked.</p>

<p>"You got that right!" Meowth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I better go talk to Giovanni," Archer said hurriedly, "He's waiting for me, but with this new information he's probably going to take action immediately."</p>

<p>Archer reached Giovanni's office as soon as he could run there, and his boss was surprised to see him arrive practically running. Nevertheless, Giovanni listened intently to all the new information and when Archer finished the account, he gave him his orders.</p>

<p>"Archer, your mission is to return to Lumiose. Take Zoe with you, and find Marcus Dryden... stop him once and for all."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>Giovanni now turned to his Persian, which was sitting on his lap purring, and said, "Persian please summon associate Zoe Rayne...have her come to my office immediately, and bring the Unowns as well."</p>

<p>Persian meowed and leapt down from his lap, scampering off and returning within five minutes with both Zoe and the group of Unowns in tow.</p>

<p>"Zoe you're going on a mission as backup for Archer," Giovanni informed her, "He will fill you in on specifics."</p>

<p>The Unowns squeaked and circled around Archer and Zoe, warping them away to the Kalos region.</p><hr>

<p>Jett hadn't been to her office at all that day.</p>

<p>She walked into the lobby of her office building to speak with the receptionist and check if she had any messages, and when she had done so, she released her Pansage, Tanzee, out of its Poké Ball. The grass type monkey appeared before her and very quickly grabbed a Sitrus Berry from a fruit bowl conveniently placed in the reception area for guests.</p>

<p>She addressed it, "Go up to the office. I'm going to come back with something special for you; it's a surprise."</p>

<p>Tanzee screeched happily and scampered off to the elevator. Swinging up by its tail, it poked the button itself for the penthouse level.</p>

<p>"Don't get into trouble while I'm out," she chided as the elevator door closed, and with an expectant glance at her Clefable was teleported out of the lobby.</p>

<p>Tanzee went up to Jett's office. The door was left ajar so her Pokémon could come and go easily.</p>

<p>In the short amount of time she'd been out, the plant had once again grown exponentially. Vines were starting to spread out of the large pot, weaving their way across the edge of her desk and cascading down akin to the gentle branches of a willow tree. The flower alone had grown to the size of a small bush around Tanzee's own height, and somehow looked all the more elegant in such grandeur; its three scarlet petals with black accents and the tall pyramid in the center, and the intoxicatingly sweet scent, the siren song of eternity.</p>

<p>Tanzee, captivated by the giant flower and its berry-like perfume, reached out to the petals with interest. The Pokémon's tail brushed against the dewy vines in the process.</p>

<p>Like in a jungle breeze, ever so softly, the leaves stirred.</p><hr>

<p>The Stone Emporium was a boutique on Vernal Avenue, well-known for its high quality evolution stones and fine jewelry. This was where Jett had gone, and within half-an-hour was returning to her office carrying a little bag with her purchase.</p>

<p>Jett took the long way back, strolling down the street with Clefable skipping by her side and taking in the last of the afternoon breeze. The sun was already descending when she arrived at her company's headquarters, and found Corbeau waiting for her in the lobby.</p>

<p>"Corbeau. What a surprise, I didn't expect to see you so soon," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Jett, I have some urgent information to give you," Corbeau told her succinctly. "Where were you?"</p>

<p>"I bought a Leaf Stone for Tanzee."</p>

<p>"Tanzee...?"</p>

<p>"My Pansage," she replied. "I'm planning to evolve him. I know he's going to be thrilled when he sees this." </p>

<p>She noticed a frown on his face and began to worry what the urgent news was all about.</p>

<p>"What is so important that couldn't wait a couple of hours?" Jett asked.</p>

<p>"The plants are carnivorous."</p>

<p> She stared at him, and he proceeded to explain. "It's not a problem – if they're small. But these grow enormous. The scientist I had looking at them says it's because they've been irradiated with elemental energy."</p>

<p>"Marcus never said anything about that...Do you think he knows?"</p>

<p>Corbeau shrugged his shoulders. "I have no clue at this point  as to whether he knows or not, but let me tell you the rest of what the scientist told me."</p>

<p>He took Jett by the arm gently and guided her to sit down, as he continued talking.</p>

<p>"They lure Pokémon to them with their scent," he said, "Large Pokémon eat the plants and get affected by the energy. Small Pokémon get ensnared by the vines and smothered in acid."</p>

<p>"That can't be!" argued Jett, "It's just a flower plant."</p>

<p>"The 'flower' isn't a flower," Corbeau replied, "it's like a Poinsettia in that it has red leaves that only look like petals. That thing in the center that looks like the stamen is its trap, which it closes on its prey. The dew on the vines isn't dew either, it's a kind of glue-like nectar it uses to hang on to anything unfortunate enough to attract its attention."</p>

<p>"How big do they get?" asked Jett, her voice with a tinge of nervousness.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the plants I had at the gym? I heard shouting and witnessed one trying to attack a gym challenger's Lillipup." Corbeau said. "I mean this very seriously... I'm lucky Salazzle is part fire type, otherwise I don't know how we would have quelled the damned plant."</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," answered Jett, "the plant in my office was growing so fast it had to be repotted...Oh no! I left Tanzee in the office..." Suddenly realizing the mistake she'd made, Jett recalled her Clefable and ran to the elevator.</p>

<p>Corbeau followed her up to the penthouse floor where she had her office. Here she found the door, which she always left ajar, was closed.</p>

<p>Jett had to put pressure on the door, which creaked a protest as it opened, as if something was barricading it. She soon discovered what was responsible.</p>

<p>Somehow within the few hours she'd been away from the office, the entire room had been overtaken by vines. They stretched out from a singular point, the pot beside her desk, where the large blossom had closed its petals. From within their center the leaves were moving, shaking, as if the plant was struggling with something. Jett approached to get a closer look.</p>

<p>It was Tanzee. The plant had gotten ahold of the monkey and the animal was fighting it. Kicking it with all its might.</p>

<p>A horrified scream escaped her, and she leapt immediately towards the flower, having to tear aside the tendrils and leaves in an attempt to reach it. Tanzee for his part, gave it a deep bite and tore off some of the stem. The vines, as if possessed, lifted angrily in response, and she ended up fighting them back as it tries to trap as well.</p>

<p>At this point, Corbeau leapt in to help her. He opened a Poké Ball to send out his Salazzle.</p>

<p>"Salazzle, Flamethrower towards the vines," he ordered, and the lizard sent out a stream of fire. It struck the tendrils, which recoiled and withered immediately in the embers.</p>

<p>Jett grabbed Tanzee by the legs and yanked him loose of the carnivorous plant's grip. The plant was dead, but the small monkey was alive, and very angry. It started chattering loudly.</p>

<p>Corbeau took Jett by the arm and helped her out from the tangled, drooping vines. "Looks like Tanzee has lots to complain about," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Well..." said Jett giving her pet a hug, "actually he's yelling insults at the plant...some of it is saucy language...I'm guessing he picked it up from the gardening crew."</p>

<p>Jett smiled, and Corbeau smiled back at her and as she cradled the little monkey, he embraced her. "I'm glad you're both alright," he said.</p>

<p>"Marcus must've known something like this could happen," she realized, "He must've known the plant would get big enough at some point and attack me or Tanzee...or anyone who walks into my office, for that matter."</p>

<p>They were silent for a minute or so and the the phone rang, breaking their thoughts.</p>

<p>Corbeau glanced at the number displayed on the screen. "...It's Marcus. You should answer it."</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation before Jett let the monkey climb up to her shoulder and she snatched up the phone receiver. She held back her fury and said simply, "I'm busy. What do you want?"</p>

<p> Marcus noticed her curtness but chalked it up to being moody, so he replied in the same fashion. "Meet me at the top of Prism Tower."</p>

<p><i>Prism Tower.</i> She turned her gaze out the window, towards the iconic building in the center of Lumiose.</p>

<p>The setting sun outlined the tower's gracefully arced column in shades of orange, the top part of which was now covered in flowering vines. Jett could scarcely believe the plants had spread outside of the rooftop garden so fast. Within a day or two they would probably overtake the entire structure.</p>

<p>She cursed the day she'd decided to entertain Marcus' plans without thinking things through, or ever thought there was a personal profit to be made in them. She'd been so shortsighted...so <i>damned</i> shortsighted.</p>

<p>"I'll be there," she replied.</p>

<p>She hung up the telephone, and glanced at Corbeau.</p>

<p>"He wants me to go to Prism Tower now."</p>

<p>"Jett, I don't trust this...I'll go and hide while you speak with him. You shouldn't be alone with him."</p>

<p>"That's up to you," she told him.</p>

<p>Jett walked around to the desk drawer and pulled out a small gun. She opened it, assured herself that it was loaded, and attached a silencer. Corbeau watched without expression, and simply recalled his Salazzle back into its Poké Ball.</p>

<p>"Let's go," she said, and they both walked out of the office.</p><h2>Chapter 28 - Winter Caller ✅</h2>

<p>The sunset had given way to nighttime in Lumiose City when Jett and Corbeau teleported up to the rooftop of Prism Tower with her Clefable. Up here at this hour it was desolate. Corbeau gave a brisk nod to Jett, and stepped soundlessly away to hide behind a wall within hearing distance.</p>

<p>The plants on the rooftop garden had grown gigantic. Some of the three-pronged red leaves with the center trap were easily eight feet high, and the vines draped themselves across anything they could. Jett was afraid to even get near them, but it was easy to steer clear of the vines. She recalled her Clefable and looked around for Marcus.</p>

<p>Observing the plants from a respectful distance, she found him.</p>

<p>"Lumiose City, the beautiful city of lights..." he contemplated, before she could speak, "It's those same lights that'll serve as a beacon to my army, so they know exactly where to target. I've left them orders to bombard the brightest city in Kalos."</p>

<p>"Marcus," said Jett simply, and she gestured towards the huge plants and the entanglement of vines that had seized Prism Tower, "Explain all this."</p>

<p>His eyebrows lifted almost jovially. "Now, you really didn't think I would take your claims at face value? I wouldn't launch an invasion of Lumiose or any other city without first ensuring victory."</p>

<p>She gazed at him, but not a word escaped her lips. He laughed and walked past her to the balcony.</p>

<p>"Success in warfare is partly psychological; if you succeed in demoralizing the enemy, it's easy to obliterate them," Marcus declared. "I'll soon have Lumiose City in terror over the plants. They'll be too fearful of the monsters growing in the ground to realize the attack coming from the sky. These flowers, you see, are my ultimate weapon."</p>

<p>"You lied to me," she said. Her voice was hoarse. "You didn't tell me they were carnivorous."</p>

<p>Marcus turned and faced Jett directly. "...and what of the fact <i>you</i> were dishonest? You claimed the mainland regions would be easy to take over. You omitted how large the rest of the world was."</p>

<p>"So neither of us was fully honest," Jett conceded. "What does it mean for Lumiose City?"</p>

<p>"I have decided to adjust my strategy. I don't need the rest of the world – quite yet. I'm perfectly content with the Kalos region. I should leave other regions unspoiled for my progeny to conquer and be acclaimed for in history, after all." He considered her briefly and went on, "I'm not one to overlook the many years of alliance your family has had with mine. You were of tremendous assistance with all the supply drops, not to mention you can still be the key to victory with your knowledge of this land."</p>

<p>"All I wanted was the south-eastern side of Lumiose razed," Jett said flatly.</p>

<p>"You've lamented countless times how petty bureaucracy prevents you from accomplishing what you want," Marcus said adding, "Do you think they will be any more forgiving, once they learn you had a hand in financing my army's little foray? Do you think the events in motion can be halted at this stage?"</p>

<p>He smirked knowingly when he saw her waver, and turned away pointedly to gaze out at the city's vast landscape.</p>

<p>"The only way to bypass those at the top is to <i>be</i> at the top. I'm going to wipe the slate as the new emperor," he added, "I'll abolish the city council and appoint you chief magistrate of Lumiose City under my reign...but only if you help."</p>

<p>"I intend to help." Her eyes narrowed. "With a clause."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I'm helping <i>stop</i> you."</p>

<p>He couldn't react to this before pain speared through his back, burning in a sudden explosion of fire. Marcus fell to the floor with an outcry, having only enough time to look up and see Jett holding a pistol with a silencer, the muzzle pointed level at his forehead.</p>

<p>"Survival of the fittest, darling," she smiled, and pulled the trigger.</p><hr>

<p>Archer and Zoe were warped to a rooftop one block from Prism Tower. The moment Archer turned and saw the building, he had a double-take.</p>

<p>"Zoe, are you seeing this?"</p>

<p>The very top of Prism Tower and its spire was entwined with flowering vines in the manner of ivy. The plants seemed to originate from the rooftop garden.</p>

<p>The Unowns had apparently travelled there with them this time, and floated beside Archer, spelling out:</p>

<p>EVIL PLANTS</p>

<p>Archer took out binoculars and looked towards Prism Tower just in time to see Jett shoot Marcus and Corbeau come out of hiding.</p>

<p>"What is it Archer? What's happening?" Zoe asked.</p>

<p>"Jett just got rid of Marcus, and Corbeau is there so..." He turned to face the Unowns, "Guys, we need you to teleport us over there to Prism Tower."</p>

<p>The Unowns obliged immediately. Archer and Zoe found themselves warped away from them to the rooftop of Prism Tower within seconds.</p>

<p>Corbeau, having pocketed Faleris' Pal Sphere in his jacket, sent out Salazzle and ordered the lizard Pokémon to use its Flamethrower attack to incinerate Marcus' remains. Jett meanwhile stood with arms crossed, her eyes focused on the large plants to ensure they didn't move towards them.</p>

<p>Both Corbeau and Jett noticed Archer and Zoe standing off to the side, yet neither said anything, even as Corbeau recalled his Pokémon after having completed its grisly task. It was Archer who spoke first.</p>

<p>"Way to go, Corbeau!" Archer said, tactfully omitting what he'd witnessed through the binoculars, "You took care of the situation and saved us the trouble."</p>

<p>Jett spoke up. "I did it."</p>

<p>Zoe and Archer looked at each other, surprised she'd admit it. Zoe said, "Mrs. Silph, apparently we have underestimated you."</p>

<p>"I had no idea the plants were dangerous," Jett explained, "He kept that information from me, and the one plant I had in my office l attacked Tanzee...fortunately I arrived in time to save him..."</p>

<p>"No need to justify this to us, Jett," dismissed Archer, "We're Team Rocket, remember. The mission Giovanni sent us on was to eliminate Marcus... that son of a bitch had it coming to him."</p>

<p>"His army is guiding themselves by the city lights for their invasion," she explained. "Which, judging from the time, should be at any point now."</p>

<p>"In that case," considered Zoe, "the best thing to do is to throw the city into darkness. That way they won't know where to hit."</p>

<p>"The controls to all the city's electrical power are here at the top of Prism Tower. Corbeau is the one who knows exactly where..." Jett turned to face the gym leader, only to find him missing.</p>

<p>The little group suddenly sank into unease like if they'd stumbled into a mire. "Where's Corbeau?" asked Jett.</p>

<p>"He was just here a minute ago," said Archer.</p>

<p>Before anything more could be said, a large vine swept down and wrapped itself around Jett. She screamed but it tightened its grip even more. They now spied Corbeau in the middle of the entanglement, restrained by tendrils that had lassoed his wrists. Archer and Zoe ran to them and tried to loosen the vines but, just as an octopus had many tentacles, the plant had many vines and the others trapped Archer and Zoe as well.</p>

<p>Now, they were all at the mercy of the carnivorous plant. The gaping center trap inched closer and closer to them as they desperately sought a way to escape.</p>

<p>"That mouth is closer than it was a minute ago," observed Zoe.</p>

<p>Jett began writhing desperately, and Corbeau's attention shot towards her as the vines began to entwine themselves further around her torso.</p>

<p>"Stop moving!" snapped Corbeau, "It reacts when you move!"</p>

<p>She stopped struggling, yet she couldn't stop shivering. Jett stared at the giant plant, her eyes wide with fear.</p>

<p>Archer tensed. "Maybe if we can reach for a Poké Ball..."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't try it," whispered Corbeau, watching the blossom as its leaves seemed to quiver. "The moment you make a move for it, the plant will make a move for <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>For at least a full nerve-racking minute, they all stayed perfectly still, facing the towering predatory plant looming before them like a promise of death. As they watched, it visibly wavered, and slowly the giant 'flower' receded and its tendrils loosened its grasp on them.</p>

<p>The instant they were able to break free, both Archer and Corbeau sent out their Pokémon. Houndoom and Salazzle both emerged from their Poké Balls, ready for a fight.</p>

<p>"Houndoom, Inferno!" called Archer.</p>

<p>"Salazzle, use Flamethrower!" Corbeau ordered.</p>

<p>The flames engulfed the plant, which reeled back in the blaze. "Jett!" Corbeau called out to her, "The electricity switch!... It's located to the left side...pull it!" </p>

<p>Jett quickly sprang to the electrical panel and pulled the lever. The lights flickered only once, and Lumiose City was cast into a blackout.</p>

<p>"The city council will throw a fit," Jett observed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and the regional government will breathe a sigh of relief once they realize we saved Lumiose," Archer replied, without missing a beat. "God willing that takes care of the invading army. Now we have to do something about the plants. They're all over the city. If the ones along the streets grow this big..."</p>

<p>"They can't be <i>permitted</i> to grow this big," Corbeau interjected. "We're going to need ten whole teams of Charizard to burn all of them."</p>

<p>"Or one strong frost," Jett said.</p>

<p>A thought occurred to Archer suddenly, and he turned towards Zoe.</p>

<p>"Zoe, you once said that Frostallion were revered on Palpagos Island for repelling calamities."</p>

<p>"Absolutely. I've heard the stories my whole life," she said, "they refer to them as the Winter Callers."</p>

<p>"I'm starting to think those alien stories might not have been so far off. Maybe around the era when Eternatus was attacking Galar, excess energy stretched to Palpagos Island like the tail of a hurricane and affected the plants there."</p>

<p>"That...sort of makes sense. Why else would they have been called 'Eternal' Flowers?" Zoe answered.</p>

<p>Archer had come up with a theory; a very crude theory, but still viable. All the strange phenomena that caused Pokémon to transform unnaturally – mega evolution from Kalos, dynamaxing from Galar – they all seemed to be different sides of the same coin, caused by the same type of energy that gave mainland Pokémon and island Pals the very ability to wield elements. <i>Colress and the rest of the Pokémon professors would probably be able to say if that's a logical deduction...</i> thought Archer, as he went on:</p>

<p>"Maybe Dryden's ancestors succeeded in getting some of the plants to germinate up on the Astral Mountains during wartime, and when people saw it they decided to surrender and flee the city there – without stopping to think the only reason they grew large in the past was a product of radiation," Archer guessed. "Then Marcus came along, realized that all the plants nowadays were small, then put two and two together and decided to try exposing them to the energy of Pokémon."</p>

<p>"That's all very interesting, but how does that help us with our present plight?" asked Jett.</p>

<p>"Well, if there were giant Eternal Flowers on Palpagos Island once upon a time, then the islanders must have found a way to eradicate them. Perhaps a Legendary Pal able to force a cold snap across the whole island."</p>

<p>He'd retrieved Frostallion's Poké Ball from his pocket, and opened the sphere in a flash of bright white light. The Pegasus emerged beside him, and reared up with a whinny.</p>

<p>"Frostallion..." Archer addressed it, "Zoe says your kind are nicknamed the Winter Callers on the island because you can summon blizzards. Is this true?"</p>

<p>Frostallion neighed affirmation, and jumped into the wind. Clouds gathered overhead, grey and vast and formless, and as the Pegasus looped around Prism Tower flying in widening concentric circles, ice billowed from its wings and the air began to grow incisive with cold.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful sight!" exclaimed Zoe.</p>

<p>"It's the middle of spring. People are going to be confused," commented Corbeau.</p>

<p>"I'm not confused, I'm just cold," Jett said flatly. "Hopefully this'll work."</p>

<p>Archer shrugged indifferently. "They'll probably figure a Legendary Pokémon did it. Which technically is true."</p>

<p>Archer looked up at the sky. Frostallion was basically waiting for his orders, so he complied.</p>

<p>"Frostallion! Use Crystal Breath over all the territory!"</p>

<p>The horse spread its wings and flew higher, stopping at some point to unleash a magnitude of ice power rarely seen. With just two blasts of frigid air, the entirety of Lumiose City was covered in ice and frost, and within seconds the monstrous plants began to die.</p>

<p>"It's working!" said Zoe, "Thanks to magnificent Frostallion!"</p>

<p>"Yes" agreed Archer, "now all we have to do is send out people to look for any stubborn plants that refuse to die and throw a fire type Pokémon at them."</p>

<p>"I can handle that," Corbeau interjected.</p>

<p>He was able to quickly contact his men from the Rust Syndicate and after explaining what was going on, gave a last order before sending them off. "...Burn the bastards!"</p>

<p>Archer recalled Frostallion, and then Jett teleported them all off to Corbeau's office.</p>

<p>By the following morning, all the Eternal Flowers were dead and everyone in Lumiose City was talking about it.</p>

<p>Archer turned to Corbeau and the two shook hands. "Nice battling with you...on the same side," smiled Archer.</p>

<p> "Same here," replied Corbeau, "When there's a mutual cause, an alliance is most beneficial."</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to mention it to Giovanni." </p>

<p>Corbeau nodded his head in response, and turned to Zoe. "I never did catch your full name, girl."</p>

<p>"It's Zoe Rayne," she replied extending her hand to shake his.</p>

<p>"You and I are distant cousins," Corbeau informed her, "My grandfather was one of the higher-ups in the Rayne Syndicate back in the day...and a cousin to Mr. Rayne, the boss. Grandfather fled to the Kalos region when the revolt happened on Palpagos Island. The plan was to have someone managing our offshore assets while the boss retook our tower base. Unfortunately it never came to be, and we lost contact with the island some years later. We slowly rebranded ourselves as the Rust Syndicate. At least, this was the family history that was passed down to me."</p>

<p>"Wow!" she exclaimed, "I never heard any of that. Thank you for telling me."</p>

<p>"Rayne Syndicate, Rust Syndicate. Rust may hide the vestiges of the past, but our business here on the mainland has stayed as strong as ever," added Corbeau with a proud smile.</p>

<p>"See you around, Corbeau," said Archer as he and Zoe turned to leave. It was then they noticed Jett. She was silently looking out the window at the cityscape. They approached her.</p>

<p>"Are you okay, Mrs. Silph?" Zoe asked.</p>

<p>Jett looked at her and said, "I'm alright. At least those that tried to hurt me and Tanzee are gone. Revenge is important to me."</p>

<p>"Totally agree, Jett," Archer replied. "Good luck."</p>

<p>He put his arm around Zoe and guided her away, and out of the building. When they got onto the sidewalk, the Unowns appeared with a trio of Team Rocket agents – Jessie, James, and Meowth.</p>

<p>"Hey! You guys are a sight for sore eyes!" Archer exclaimed happily.</p>

<p>"The boss is satisfied with your work, Archer," Meowth informed him, "He sent us to see if you and Zoe needed a ride back."</p>

<p>"That'll be fine," he replied, as the Unowns squeaked with joy.</p>

<p>"Well on the topic of Unowns..." Jessie said,  "You know their cousins, the Zygarde?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Apparently they didn't like the idea of their home here in Lumiose getting fucked with that way. They sought out Marcus' PIDF army out in the ocean. They got totally thrashed."</p>

<p>"The Zygarde?"</p>

<p>"No, the PIDF."</p>

<p>"Looks like all those Zygarde can combine into one giant Zygarde to kick ass," added James, "They sank all the islanders' ships and knocked out all their Pals in one swoop. I think it's fair to say that's the last we'll see of those well-laid plans of conquest."</p>

<p>"Good riddance!" said Zoe.</p>

<p>The crisis averted in Lumiose City, and Palpagos Island now completely ruled by Rocket Enterprises, life settled into a slower, more predictable pace for everyone. Giovanni gathered all the squadrons that were on the island, as well as the Syndicate members, for a meeting.</p>

<p>The information given out was basic. The Syndicate was no more, since all its members were now considered part of Team Rocket. Exceptions were given to those who wanted to get out of it and lead civilian lives. Team Rocket squadrons would rotate every two weeks on the island and go back to the mainland afterwards. Giovanni's intent was to ensure that no rogue group of islanders would rebel and grab hold of power. He would visit on occasion, but now he would return to the Kanto region along with his personal trio of guards, Jessie, James and Meowth.</p>

<p>At the moment what was first and foremost on Giovanni's mind was his wife Delia. He was eager to see her. He had been calling her every day he was on the island but a month had gone by and he missed the day-to-day life with her. They were both looking forward to reuniting.</p>

<p>As for Archer, he returned to the mainland. Zoe remained on the island as a coordinator of training for new recruits. They had parted ways amicably, and remained friends.</p>

<p>Thanks to Giovanni's investments, Palpagos Island was completely developed into an exotic resort for all on the mainland to visit. The island people benefited enormously from the tourism revenue, which only enhanced their loyalty towards Team Rocket and in particular towards Giovanni. Everyone on the island spoke highly of him, not by coercion but by admiration.</p>

<p>Yet despite all this, there was still something that remained an unaddressed curiosity to Archer. The tale he'd heard of Zygarde's power in defeating a whole army had left him with wonderment, and when the Unowns showed up again – as they tended to do, for no apparent reason, in the middle of Team Rocket headquarters in Celadon City to say hi and drift around Archer as if he was unofficially their trainer – he inquired:</p>

<p>"If your cousins have such power, what do you guys do?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and he elaborated:</p>

<p>"I mean, I know you teleport around and all that. But the few people who've been lucky enough to catch and train a single Unown say you guys know an attack called Hidden Power. No one has been able to figure out how it works. Do groups of Unown have another secret skill no human has seen yet?"</p>

<p>The Unown squeaked all at once in reply and twirled about in mid-air. One could have easily been forgiven for believing they were laughing – whether at the thought of such a notion or because they fully intended to keep their hidden power, hidden. And Archer could have also been forgiven for laughing right along with them.</p>
